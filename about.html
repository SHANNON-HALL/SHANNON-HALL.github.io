          <h3>About Me</h3>

					<p>Hello! My name is Shannon Hall, and I am a first-year graduate student here at the University of Tennessee,
						Knoxville. I completed my undergrad, for a bachelors in mathematics, also at the University of Tennessee.
						My love for math began in high school when I took a calculus class for the first time. Nowadays, I am
						mainly interested in what most mathematicians would call pure math, although I still do enjoy applied
						math. This basically means that I like doing math for the sake of doing math. I have had some experience
						with abstract algebra recently, but I want to delve more into some other areas before I settle down with
						one specific branch of mathematics. I am excited to learn all that I can at UT!</p>

					<p>I also have a minor in computer science, and I enjoy programming and computers in general. Most of my
						experience is with C++, but I have had much more experience recently using Python for my math courses and
						other everyday tasks. Check out my GitHub link at the bottom of this page for some of my projects!</p>

					<hr />

					<p>Outside of school, I have plenty of other hobbies. I am a Christian, and I have participated in some
						groups, like the Turn and VolCatholic, at UT. I enjoy listening to and learning about music, and I can
						currently play some piano and guitar. I like to work out, especially when it comes to running and
						weightlifting. Other than that, I enjoy most sports, and I like being outdoors in general. I have a
						collection of Rubik's cubes, and I enjoy speedcubing, although I am a little more rusty than I used to be,
						thanks to college.</p>

					<p>Of course, this is just a small amount of the things that I enjoy, and I am always up to do new things.
						Overall, I love to learn, and I hope that there is never a day that I have to stop!</p>

					<hr />

					<p>Here is my fianc√©, Stephanie, and my two cat friends. The grey cat friend is the little buddy, and the
						black cat friend is naked belly. We also call them baby one and Juniper. They are all very nice, and I love
						them very much.</p>
