<font size = "+2"><b>217: Sirach 23:27 - Sirach 27:25</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:27</b></font> And they that remain shall know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter than to take heed unto the commandments of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:28</b></font> It is great glory to follow the Lord, and to be received of him is long life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst of her people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a possession. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portion of the Lord's inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance than the honeycomb. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:28</b></font> The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:29</b></font> For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:30</b></font> I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:31</b></font> I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:32</b></font> I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:33</b></font> I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:34</b></font> Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> Give me any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:22</b></font> An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:23</b></font> A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:24</b></font> A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:25</b></font> A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:26</b></font> A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:27</b></font> A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:28</b></font> There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:29</b></font> A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:5</b></font> The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:6</b></font> The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:8</b></font> If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:9</b></font> The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:10</b></font> As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:11</b></font> The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:12</b></font> If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:13</b></font> The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:14</b></font> The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:15</b></font> The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:16</b></font> Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:17</b></font> Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:18</b></font> For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:19</b></font> As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:20</b></font> Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:21</b></font> As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:22</b></font> He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:23</b></font> When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:24</b></font> I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:25</b></font> Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds. </font>
