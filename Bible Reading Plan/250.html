<font size = "+2"><b>250: Jeremiah 36:11 - Jeremiah 39:3</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:11</b></font> When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:12</b></font> Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:13</b></font> Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:14</b></font> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:15</b></font> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:16</b></font> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:17</b></font> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:18</b></font> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:19</b></font> Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:20</b></font> And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:21</b></font> So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:22</b></font> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:23</b></font> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:24</b></font> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:25</b></font> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:26</b></font> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:27</b></font> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:28</b></font> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:29</b></font> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:30</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:31</b></font> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:32</b></font> Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:1</b></font> And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:2</b></font> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:7</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:8</b></font> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:9</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:10</b></font> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:11</b></font> And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:12</b></font> Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:13</b></font> And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:14</b></font> Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:15</b></font> Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:16</b></font> When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:17</b></font> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:18</b></font> Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:19</b></font> Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:20</b></font> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:21</b></font> Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:1</b></font> Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:3</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:4</b></font> Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:5</b></font> Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:6</b></font> Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:7</b></font> Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:8</b></font> Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:9</b></font> My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:10</b></font> Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:11</b></font> So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:12</b></font> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:13</b></font> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:14</b></font> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:15</b></font> Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:16</b></font> So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:17</b></font> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:18</b></font> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:19</b></font> And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:20</b></font> But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:21</b></font> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:22</b></font> And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:23</b></font> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:24</b></font> Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:25</b></font> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:26</b></font> Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:27</b></font> Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:28</b></font> So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:1</b></font> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:2</b></font> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:3</b></font> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab- saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. </font>
