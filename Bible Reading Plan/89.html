<font size = "+2"><b>89: 1 Samuel 25:1 - 1 Samuel 27:4</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:27</b></font> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:28</b></font> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:29</b></font> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:30</b></font> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:31</b></font> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:32</b></font> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:33</b></font> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:34</b></font> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:35</b></font> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:36</b></font> And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:37</b></font> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:38</b></font> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:39</b></font> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:40</b></font> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:41</b></font> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:42</b></font> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:43</b></font> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:44</b></font> But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:22</b></font> And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:23</b></font> The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:24</b></font> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:25</b></font> Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. </font>
