<font size = "+2"><b>333: Acts of the Apostles 18:24 - Acts of the Apostles 21:14</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And all the men were about twelve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:31</b></font> And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:32</b></font> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:33</b></font> And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:34</b></font> But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:35</b></font> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:36</b></font> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:37</b></font> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:38</b></font> Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:39</b></font> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:40</b></font> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:41</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> These going before tarried for us at Troas. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:27</b></font> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:28</b></font> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:29</b></font> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:30</b></font> Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:31</b></font> Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:32</b></font> And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:33</b></font> I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:34</b></font> Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:35</b></font> I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:36</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:37</b></font> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:38</b></font> Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. </font>
