for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:31</b></font> Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:32</b></font> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:33</b></font> And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:34</b></font> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:35</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:36</b></font> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:37</b></font> For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:38</b></font> And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:39</b></font> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:1</b></font> The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:2</b></font> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:3</b></font> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:4</b></font> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:5</b></font> They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:6</b></font> My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:7</b></font> All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:8</b></font> Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:9</b></font> For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:10</b></font> And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:11</b></font> Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:12</b></font> Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:13</b></font> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:14</b></font> Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:15</b></font> Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:16</b></font> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:17</b></font> Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:18</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:19</b></font> And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:20</b></font> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:21</b></font> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:22</b></font> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:23</b></font> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:24</b></font> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:25</b></font> The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:26</b></font> Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:27</b></font> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:28</b></font> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:29</b></font> Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:30</b></font> Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:31</b></font> Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:32</b></font> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:33</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:34</b></font> Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:35</b></font> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:36</b></font> A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:37</b></font> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:38</b></font> A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:39</b></font> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:40</b></font> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:41</b></font> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:42</b></font> They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:43</b></font> The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:44</b></font> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:45</b></font> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:46</b></font> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:1</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:2</b></font> And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:3</b></font> Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:4</b></font> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:5</b></font> For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:6</b></font> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:7</b></font> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:8</b></font> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:9</b></font> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:10</b></font> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:11</b></font> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:12</b></font> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:13</b></font> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:14</b></font> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:15</b></font> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:16</b></font> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:17</b></font> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:18</b></font> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:19</b></font> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:20</b></font> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:21</b></font> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:22</b></font> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:23</b></font> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:24</b></font> And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:25</b></font> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:26</b></font> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:27</b></font> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:28</b></font> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:29</b></font> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:30</b></font> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:31</b></font> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:32</b></font> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:33</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:34</b></font> Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:35</b></font> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:36</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:37</b></font> And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:38</b></font> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:39</b></font> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:40</b></font> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:41</b></font> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:42</b></font> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:43</b></font> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:44</b></font> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:45</b></font> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:46</b></font> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:47</b></font> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:48</b></font> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:49</b></font> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:50</b></font> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:51</b></font> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:52</b></font> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:53</b></font> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:54</b></font> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:55</b></font> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:56</b></font> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:57</b></font> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:58</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary. </font>
