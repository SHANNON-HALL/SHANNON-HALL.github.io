Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' sope: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And Aram begat Aminadab;

1:18</b></font> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. </font>
