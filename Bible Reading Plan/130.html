So all Israel went to their tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.

And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about. </font>
