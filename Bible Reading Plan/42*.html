5:13</b></font> And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

6:6</b></font> All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

6:16</b></font> And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
