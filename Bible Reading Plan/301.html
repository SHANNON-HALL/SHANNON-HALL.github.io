<font size = "+2"><b>301: Matthew 24:3 - Matthew 26:25</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> All these are the beginning of sorrows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> Behold, I have told you before. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:28</b></font> For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:29</b></font> Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:30</b></font> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:31</b></font> And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:32</b></font> Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:33</b></font> So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:34</b></font> Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:35</b></font> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:36</b></font> But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:37</b></font> But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:38</b></font> For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:39</b></font> And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:40</b></font> Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:41</b></font> Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:42</b></font> Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:43</b></font> But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:44</b></font> Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:45</b></font> Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:46</b></font> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:47</b></font> Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:48</b></font> But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:49</b></font> And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:50</b></font> The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:51</b></font> And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:27</b></font> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:28</b></font> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:29</b></font> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:30</b></font> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:31</b></font> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:32</b></font> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:33</b></font> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:34</b></font> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:35</b></font> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:36</b></font> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:37</b></font> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:38</b></font> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:39</b></font> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:40</b></font> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:41</b></font> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:42</b></font> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:43</b></font> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:44</b></font> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:45</b></font> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:46</b></font> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:22</b></font> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:23</b></font> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:24</b></font> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:25</b></font> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. </font>
