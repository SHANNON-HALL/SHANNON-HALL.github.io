29:9</b></font> The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace. <p>Psalm 30 <p>A Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
