And they said, So do, as thou hast said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.

And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:31</b></font> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:32</b></font> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:33</b></font> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:34</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:35</b></font> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:36</b></font> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:37</b></font> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:38</b></font> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. </font>
