<font size = "+2"><b>159: 1 Maccabees 6:27 - 1 Maccabees 8:4</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them quickly, they will do the greater things than these, neither shalt thou be able to rule them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, and the captains of his army, and those that had charge of the horse. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> There came also unto him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> So that the number of his army was an hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephants exercised in battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura, which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and pitched in Bathzacharias, over against the king's camp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> Then the king rising very early marched fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready to battle, and sounded the trumpets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> And to the end they might provoke the elephants to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> Moreover they divided the beasts among the armies, and for every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and beside this, for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen of the best. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beast was, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neither departed they from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with devices: there were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:38</b></font> As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on this side and that side at the two parts of the host giving them signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:39</b></font> Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:40</b></font> So part of the king's army being spread upon the high mountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on safely and in order. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:41</b></font> Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of the harness, were moved: for the army was very great and mighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:42</b></font> Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered into battle, and there were slain of the king's army six hundred men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:43</b></font> Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of the beasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest, and supposing that the king was upon him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:44</b></font> Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his people, and get him a perpetual name: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:45</b></font> Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through the midst of the battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so that they were divided from him on both sides. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:46</b></font> Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust him under, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon him, and there he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:47</b></font> Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the strength of the king, and the violence of his forces, turned away from them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:48</b></font> Then the king's army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king pitched his tents against Judea, and against mount Sion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:49</b></font> But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:50</b></font> So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keep it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:51</b></font> As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days: and set there artillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts and slings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:52</b></font> Whereupon they also made engines against their engines, and held them battle a long season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:53</b></font> Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:54</b></font> There were but a few left in the sanctuary, because the famine did so prevail against them, that they were fain to disperse themselves, every man to his own place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:55</b></font> At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus, that he might be king, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:56</b></font> Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the king's host also that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him the ruling of the affairs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:57</b></font> Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the king and the captains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and our victuals are but small, and the place we lay siege unto is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:58</b></font> Now therefore let us be friends with these men, and make peace with them, and with all their nation; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:59</b></font> And covenant with them, that they shall live after their laws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, and have done all these things, because we abolished their laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:60</b></font> So the king and the princes were content: wherefore he sent unto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:61</b></font> Also the king and the princes made an oath unto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:62</b></font> Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when he saw the strength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:63</b></font> Afterward departed he in all haste, and returned unto Antiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city: so he fought against him, and took the city by force. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son of Seleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city of the sea coast, and reigned there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see their faces. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of his kingdom, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see what havock he hath made among us, and in the king's land, and let him punish them with all them that aid them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Judea, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to require justice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with this army, and he will do us no wrong. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them, saying, we will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the words which he wrote, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their blood have they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; for they have broken the covenant and oath that they made. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that had forsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he had slain them, he cast them into the great pit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who, after they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, did much hurt in Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durst no more go forth into the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went again to the king, and said all the worst of them that he could. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, a man that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sent unto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see you in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by violence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he came unto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered, went out to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> Where there were slain of Nicanor's side about five thousand men, and the rest fled into the city of David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came out of the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the burnt sacrifice that was offered for the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spake proudly, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:39</b></font> So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:40</b></font> But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:41</b></font> O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:42</b></font> Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:43</b></font> So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:44</b></font> Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:45</b></font> Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:46</b></font> Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:47</b></font> Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:48</b></font> For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a day of great gladness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:49</b></font> Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:50</b></font> Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Now Judas had heard of the the Romans, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would lovingly accept all that joined themselves unto them, and make a league of amity with all that came unto them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And that they were men of great valour. It was told him also of their wars and noble acts which they had done among the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And what they had done in the country of Spain, for the winning of the mines of the silver and gold which is there; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And that by their policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very far from them; and the kings also that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year: </font>
