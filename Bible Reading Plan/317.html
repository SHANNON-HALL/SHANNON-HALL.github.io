<font size = "+2"><b>317: Luke 20:19 - Luke 22:49</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:27</b></font> Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:28</b></font> Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:29</b></font> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:30</b></font> And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:31</b></font> And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:32</b></font> Last of all the woman died also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:33</b></font> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:34</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:35</b></font> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:36</b></font> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:37</b></font> Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:38</b></font> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:39</b></font> Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:40</b></font> And after that they durst not ask him any question at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:41</b></font> And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:42</b></font> And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:43</b></font> Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:44</b></font> David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:45</b></font> Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:46</b></font> Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:47</b></font> Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> And it shall turn to you for a testimony. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> But there shall not an hair of your head perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> In your patience possess ye your souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:22</b></font> For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:23</b></font> But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:24</b></font> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:25</b></font> And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:26</b></font> Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:27</b></font> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:28</b></font> And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:29</b></font> And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:30</b></font> When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:31</b></font> So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:32</b></font> Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:33</b></font> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:34</b></font> And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:35</b></font> For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:36</b></font> Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:37</b></font> And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:38</b></font> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:3</b></font> Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:25</b></font> And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:27</b></font> For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:28</b></font> Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:29</b></font> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:30</b></font> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:31</b></font> And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:32</b></font> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:33</b></font> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:34</b></font> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:35</b></font> And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:36</b></font> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:37</b></font> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:38</b></font> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:39</b></font> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:40</b></font> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:41</b></font> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:42</b></font> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:43</b></font> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:44</b></font> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:45</b></font> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:46</b></font> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:47</b></font> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:48</b></font> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:49</b></font> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? </font>
