<font size = "+2"><b>309: Luke 2:1 - Luke 4:13</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:37</b></font> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:38</b></font> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:39</b></font> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:40</b></font> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:41</b></font> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:42</b></font> And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:43</b></font> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:44</b></font> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:45</b></font> And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:46</b></font> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:47</b></font> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:48</b></font> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:49</b></font> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:50</b></font> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:51</b></font> And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:52</b></font> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:37</b></font> Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:38</b></font> Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. </font>
