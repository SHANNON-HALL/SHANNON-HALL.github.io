<font size = "+2"><b>81: 1 Samuel 1:19 - 1 Samuel 4:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. </font>
