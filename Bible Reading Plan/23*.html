that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God.
