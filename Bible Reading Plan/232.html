<font size = "+2"><b>232: Isaiah 37:37 - Isaiah 41:29</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:37</b></font> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:38</b></font> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:1</b></font> In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:2</b></font> Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:3</b></font> And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:4</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:5</b></font> Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:6</b></font> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:7</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:8</b></font> Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:9</b></font> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:10</b></font> I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:11</b></font> I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:12</b></font> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:13</b></font> I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:14</b></font> Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:15</b></font> What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:16</b></font> O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:17</b></font> Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:18</b></font> For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:19</b></font> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:20</b></font> The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:21</b></font> For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:22</b></font> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:1</b></font> At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:2</b></font> And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:3</b></font> Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:4</b></font> Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:5</b></font> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:6</b></font> Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:7</b></font> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:8</b></font> Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:1</b></font> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:2</b></font> Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:3</b></font> The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:4</b></font> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:5</b></font> And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:6</b></font> The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:7</b></font> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:8</b></font> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:9</b></font> O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:10</b></font> Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:11</b></font> He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:12</b></font> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
