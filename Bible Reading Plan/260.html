I the LORD have spoken it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. </font>
