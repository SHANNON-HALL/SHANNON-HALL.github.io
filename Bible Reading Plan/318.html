<font size = "+2"><b>318: Luke 22:50 - Luke 24:48</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:50</b></font> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:51</b></font> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:52</b></font> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:53</b></font> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:54</b></font> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:55</b></font> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:56</b></font> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:57</b></font> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:58</b></font> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:59</b></font> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:60</b></font> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:61</b></font> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:62</b></font> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:63</b></font> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:64</b></font> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:65</b></font> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:66</b></font> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:67</b></font> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:68</b></font> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:69</b></font> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:70</b></font> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:71</b></font> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> I will therefore chastise him, and release him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:21</b></font> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:22</b></font> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:23</b></font> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:24</b></font> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:25</b></font> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:26</b></font> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:27</b></font> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:28</b></font> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:29</b></font> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:30</b></font> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:31</b></font> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:32</b></font> And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:33</b></font> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:34</b></font> Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:35</b></font> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:36</b></font> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:37</b></font> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:38</b></font> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:39</b></font> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:40</b></font> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:41</b></font> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:42</b></font> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:43</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:44</b></font> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:45</b></font> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:46</b></font> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:47</b></font> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:48</b></font> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:49</b></font> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:50</b></font> And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:51</b></font> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:52</b></font> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:53</b></font> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:54</b></font> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:55</b></font> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:56</b></font> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> And they remembered his words, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> And they talked together of all these things which had happened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:28</b></font> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:29</b></font> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:30</b></font> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:31</b></font> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:32</b></font> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:33</b></font> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:34</b></font> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:35</b></font> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:36</b></font> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:37</b></font> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:38</b></font> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:39</b></font> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:40</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:41</b></font> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:42</b></font> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:43</b></font> And he took it, and did eat before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:44</b></font> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:45</b></font> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:46</b></font> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:47</b></font> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:48</b></font> And ye are witnesses of these things. </font>
