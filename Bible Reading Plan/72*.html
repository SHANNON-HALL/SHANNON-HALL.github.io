So Simeon went with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath- arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.

(Now the name of the city before was Luz.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

1:28</b></font> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

2:2</b></font> And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan- rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan- rishathaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. </font>
