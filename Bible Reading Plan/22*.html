These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And God spake all these words, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> Thou shalt have no other gods before me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> Thou shalt not kill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> Thou shalt not commit adultery. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> Thou shalt not steal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. </font>
