Is there not a cause? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:30</b></font> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:31</b></font> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:32</b></font> And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:33</b></font> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:34</b></font> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:35</b></font> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:36</b></font> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:37</b></font> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:38</b></font> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:39</b></font> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:40</b></font> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:41</b></font> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:42</b></font> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:43</b></font> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:44</b></font> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:45</b></font> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:46</b></font> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:47</b></font> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:48</b></font> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:49</b></font> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:50</b></font> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:51</b></font> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:52</b></font> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:53</b></font> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:54</b></font> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:55</b></font> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:56</b></font> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:57</b></font> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:58</b></font> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. </font>
