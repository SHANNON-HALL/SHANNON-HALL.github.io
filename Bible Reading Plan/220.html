<font size = "+2"><b>220: Sirach 37:2 - Sirach 40:10</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:2</b></font> Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:7</b></font> Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:8</b></font> Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:9</b></font> And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:10</b></font> Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:11</b></font> Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:12</b></font> But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:13</b></font> And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:14</b></font> For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:15</b></font> And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:16</b></font> Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:17</b></font> The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:18</b></font> Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them continually. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:19</b></font> There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:20</b></font> There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:21</b></font> For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:22</b></font> Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:23</b></font> A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:24</b></font> A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:25</b></font> The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:26</b></font> A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:27</b></font> My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:28</b></font> For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:29</b></font> Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:30</b></font> For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:31</b></font> By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:1</b></font> Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:2</b></font> For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:3</b></font> The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:4</b></font> The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:5</b></font> Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:6</b></font> And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:7</b></font> With such doth he heal men, and taketh away their pains. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:8</b></font> Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:9</b></font> My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:10</b></font> Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:11</b></font> Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:12</b></font> Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:13</b></font> There is a time when in their hands there is good success. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:14</b></font> For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:15</b></font> He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:16</b></font> My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:17</b></font> Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:18</b></font> For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:19</b></font> In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:20</b></font> Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:21</b></font> Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:22</b></font> Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:23</b></font> When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:24</b></font> The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:25</b></font> How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:26</b></font> He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:27</b></font> So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:28</b></font> The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:29</b></font> So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:30</b></font> He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:31</b></font> All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:32</b></font> Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:33</b></font> They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:34</b></font> But they will maintain the state of the world, and all their desire is in the work of their craft. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:1</b></font> But he that giveth his mind to the law of the most High, and is occupied in the meditation thereof, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancient, and be occupied in prophecies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:2</b></font> He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: and where subtil parables are, he will be there also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:3</b></font> He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and be conversant in dark parables. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:4</b></font> He shall serve among great men, and appear before princes: he will travel through strange countries; for he hath tried the good and the evil among men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:5</b></font> He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray before the most High, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:6</b></font> When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spirit of understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give thanks unto the Lord in his prayer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:7</b></font> He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets shall he meditate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:8</b></font> He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:9</b></font> Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as the world endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall not depart away, and his name shall live from generation to generation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:10</b></font> Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregation shall declare his praise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:11</b></font> If he die, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand: and if he live, he shall increase it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:12</b></font> Yet have I more to say, which I have thought upon; for I am filled as the moon at the full. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:13</b></font> Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bud forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:14</b></font> And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and flourish as a lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lord in all his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:15</b></font> Magnify his name, and shew forth his praise with the songs of your lips, and with harps, and in praising him ye shall say after this manner: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:16</b></font> All the works of the Lord are exceeding good, and whatsoever he commandeth shall be accomplished in due season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:17</b></font> And none may say, What is this? wherefore is that? for at time convenient they shall all be sought out: at his commandment the waters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth the receptacles of waters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:18</b></font> At his commandment is done whatsoever pleaseth him; and none can hinder, when he will save. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:19</b></font> The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can be hid from his eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:20</b></font> He seeth from everlasting to everlasting; and there is nothing wonderful before him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:21</b></font> A man need not to say, What is this? wherefore is that? for he hath made all things for their uses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:22</b></font> His blessing covered the dry land as a river, and watered it as a flood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:23</b></font> As he hath turned the waters into saltness: so shall the heathen inherit his wrath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:24</b></font> As his ways are plain unto the holy; so are they stumblingblocks unto the wicked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:25</b></font> For the good are good things created from the beginning: so evil things for sinners. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:26</b></font> The principal things for the whole use of man's life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:27</b></font> All these things are for good to the godly: so to the sinners they are turned into evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:28</b></font> There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:29</b></font> Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:30</b></font> Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, and the sword punishing the wicked to destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:31</b></font> They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they shall be ready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come, they shall not transgress his word. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:32</b></font> Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and thought upon these things, and have left them in writing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:33</b></font> All the works of the Lord are good: and he will give every needful thing in due season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:34</b></font> So that a man cannot say, This is worse than that: for in time they shall all be well approved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:35</b></font> And therefore praise ye the Lord with the whole heart and mouth, and bless the name of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:1</b></font> Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:2</b></font> Their imagination of things to come, and the day of death, trouble their thoughts, and cause fear of heart; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:3</b></font> From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, unto him that is humbled in earth and ashes; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:4</b></font> From him that weareth purple and a crown, unto him that is clothed with a linen frock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:5</b></font> Wrath, and envy, trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, and anger, and strife, and in the time of rest upon his bed his night sleep, do change his knowledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:6</b></font> A little or nothing is his rest, and afterward he is in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch, troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he were escaped out of a battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:7</b></font> When all is safe, he awaketh, and marvelleth that the fear was nothing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:8</b></font> Such things happen unto all flesh, both man and beast, and that is sevenfold more upon sinners. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:9</b></font> Death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:10</b></font> These things are created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood. </font>
