And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good. </font>
