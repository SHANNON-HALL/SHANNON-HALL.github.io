<font size = "+2"><b>76: Judges 11:12 - Judges 14:9</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:39</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:40</b></font> That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. </font>
