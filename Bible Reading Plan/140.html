And they sware. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days.
