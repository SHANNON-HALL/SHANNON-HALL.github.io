And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:36</b></font> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:37</b></font> So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo- debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:28</b></font> Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:29</b></font> And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. </font>
