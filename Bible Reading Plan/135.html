But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:19</b></font> That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:20</b></font> And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:21</b></font> And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:22</b></font> And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:23</b></font> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:24</b></font> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:25</b></font> And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:26</b></font> So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:27</b></font> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:1</b></font> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:2</b></font> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:3</b></font> He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:4</b></font> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:14</b></font> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:15</b></font> And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:16</b></font> Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:17</b></font> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:18</b></font> And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:19</b></font> Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:20</b></font> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:21</b></font> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:6</b></font> And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:7</b></font> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:8</b></font> With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:9</b></font> After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:10</b></font> Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:11</b></font> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:12</b></font> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:13</b></font> Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:14</b></font> Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:15</b></font> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:16</b></font> And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:17</b></font> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:18</b></font> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:19</b></font> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:20</b></font> And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:21</b></font> And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:22</b></font> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:23</b></font> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. </font>
