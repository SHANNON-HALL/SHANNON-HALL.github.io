<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> Until I make thy foes thy footstool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:37</b></font> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:38</b></font> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:39</b></font> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:40</b></font> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:41</b></font> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:42</b></font> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:43</b></font> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:44</b></font> And all that believed were together, and had all things common; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:45</b></font> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:46</b></font> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:47</b></font> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And all the people saw him walking and praising God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. </font>
