But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? <p><p><p><b>Micah</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened?
