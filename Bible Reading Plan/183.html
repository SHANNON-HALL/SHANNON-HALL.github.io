33:2</b></font> Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:12</b></font> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD: and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:13</b></font> The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:21</b></font> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:22</b></font> Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. <p>Psalm 34 <p>A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:1</b></font> I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:13</b></font> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:14</b></font> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:15</b></font> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:16</b></font> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:17</b></font> The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:18</b></font> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:19</b></font> Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:20</b></font> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:21</b></font> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:22</b></font> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate. <p>Psalm 35 <p>A Psalm of David. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:1</b></font> Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:2</b></font> Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:3</b></font> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:4</b></font> Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:5</b></font> Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:6</b></font> Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:7</b></font> For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:8</b></font> Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:9</b></font> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:10</b></font> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:11</b></font> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:12</b></font> They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:13</b></font> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:14</b></font> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:15</b></font> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:16</b></font> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:17</b></font> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:18</b></font> I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:19</b></font> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:20</b></font> For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:21</b></font> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:22</b></font> This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:23</b></font> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:24</b></font> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:25</b></font> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:26</b></font> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:27</b></font> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:28</b></font> And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long. <p>Psalm 36 <p>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:1</b></font> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:2</b></font> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:7</b></font> How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:8</b></font> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:9</b></font> For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:10</b></font> O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:11</b></font> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:12</b></font> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. <p>Psalm 37 <p>A Psalm of David. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:1</b></font> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:2</b></font> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:7</b></font> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:8</b></font> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:9</b></font> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:10</b></font> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:11</b></font> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:12</b></font> The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:13</b></font> The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:14</b></font> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:15</b></font> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:16</b></font> A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:17</b></font> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:18</b></font> The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:19</b></font> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:20</b></font> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:21</b></font> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:22</b></font> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:23</b></font> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:24</b></font> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:25</b></font> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:26</b></font> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:27</b></font> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:28</b></font> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:29</b></font> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:30</b></font> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:31</b></font> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:32</b></font> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:33</b></font> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:34</b></font> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:35</b></font> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:36</b></font> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:37</b></font> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:38</b></font> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:39</b></font> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:40</b></font> And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. <p>Psalm 38 <p>A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:1</b></font> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:2</b></font> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:3</b></font> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:4</b></font> For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:5</b></font> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:6</b></font> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:7</b></font> For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:8</b></font> I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:9</b></font> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:10</b></font> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:11</b></font> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:12</b></font> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:13</b></font> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:14</b></font> Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:15</b></font> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:16</b></font> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:17</b></font> For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:18</b></font> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:19</b></font> But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:20</b></font> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:21</b></font> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:22</b></font> Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. </font>
