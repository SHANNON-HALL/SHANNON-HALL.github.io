<font size = "+2"><b>337: Romans 3:19 - Romans 7:25</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And patience, experience; and experience, hope: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> For he that is dead is freed from sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. </font>
