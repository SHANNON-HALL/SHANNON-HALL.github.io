<font size = "+2"><b>149: Judith 7:13 - Judith 10:1</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not thy person peaceably. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us great injury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and great destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives nor our children to die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, I will do according to your word. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge; and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low brought in the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, who died in the barley harvest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in the field, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in the city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothaim and Balamo. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves of the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the new moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful to behold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, and menservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remained upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And there was none that gave her an ill word; as she feared God greatly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Now when she heard the evil words of the people against the governor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard all the words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that he had sworn to deliver the city unto the Assyrians after five days; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, the ancients of the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now, O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that ye have spoken before the people this day are not right, touching this oath which ye made and pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turn to help you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and stand instead of God among the children of men? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know any thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither can ye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye search out God, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> For if he will not help us within these five days, he hath power to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy us before our enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man, that he should be wavering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now in these days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us, which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he will not despise us, nor any of our nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereof at our mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the country, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to our brethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, and the house, and the altar, rest upon us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which trieth us, even as he did our fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he tried Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother's brother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for the examination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us: but the Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thy words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people have known thy understanding, because the disposition of thine heart is good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do unto them as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forth with my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promised to deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by mine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare it unto you, till the things be finished that I do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the time that the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the house of the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that they dyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dear children; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also a widow. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also the things which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hast thought upon the things which are now, and which are to come. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, and said, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thy judgments are in thy foreknowledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; they are exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of their footmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and know not that thou art the Lord that breakest the battles: the Lord is thy name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down their force in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to cast down with sword the horn of thy altar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: give into mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by the hand of a woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might in strong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a saviour of them that are without hope. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of the waters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thy hallowed house, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of the possession of thy children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou art the God of all power and might, and that there is none other that protecteth the people of Israel but thou. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel, and bad made an end of all these words. </font>
