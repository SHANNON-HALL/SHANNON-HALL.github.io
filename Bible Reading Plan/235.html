for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 53:9</b></font> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 53:10</b></font> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 53:11</b></font> He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 53:12</b></font> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </font>
