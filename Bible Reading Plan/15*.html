And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:10</b></font> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:11</b></font> And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:12</b></font> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:13</b></font> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:14</b></font> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:15</b></font> And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:16</b></font> The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:17</b></font> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:18</b></font> And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:19</b></font> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:20</b></font> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:21</b></font> And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:22</b></font> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. </font>
