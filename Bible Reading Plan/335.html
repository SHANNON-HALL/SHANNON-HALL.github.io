<font size = "+2"><b>335: Acts of the Apostles 24:1 - Acts of the Apostles 27:44</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:27</b></font> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:22</b></font> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:23</b></font> That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:24</b></font> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:25</b></font> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:26</b></font> For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:27</b></font> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:28</b></font> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:29</b></font> And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:30</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:31</b></font> And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:32</b></font> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:5</b></font> And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:6</b></font> And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:8</b></font> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:9</b></font> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:10</b></font> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:11</b></font> Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:12</b></font> And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:13</b></font> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:14</b></font> But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:15</b></font> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:16</b></font> And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:17</b></font> Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:18</b></font> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:19</b></font> And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:20</b></font> And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:21</b></font> But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:22</b></font> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:23</b></font> For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:24</b></font> Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:25</b></font> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:26</b></font> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:27</b></font> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:28</b></font> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:29</b></font> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:30</b></font> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:31</b></font> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:32</b></font> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:33</b></font> And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:34</b></font> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:35</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:36</b></font> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:37</b></font> And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:38</b></font> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:39</b></font> And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:40</b></font> And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:41</b></font> And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:42</b></font> And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:43</b></font> But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:44</b></font> And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land. </font>
