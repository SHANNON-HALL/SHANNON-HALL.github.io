Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer- sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:22</b></font> Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:23</b></font> And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo,I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:24</b></font> And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:25</b></font> So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:26</b></font> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:27</b></font> And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. </font>
