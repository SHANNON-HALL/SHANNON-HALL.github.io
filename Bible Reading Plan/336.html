<font size = "+2"><b>336: Acts of the Apostles 28:1 - Romans 3:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:1</b></font> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:2</b></font> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:3</b></font> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:4</b></font> And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:5</b></font> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:6</b></font> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:7</b></font> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:8</b></font> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:9</b></font> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:10</b></font> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:11</b></font> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:12</b></font> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:13</b></font> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:14</b></font> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:15</b></font> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:16</b></font> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:17</b></font> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:18</b></font> Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:19</b></font> But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:20</b></font> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:21</b></font> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:22</b></font> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:23</b></font> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:24</b></font> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:25</b></font> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:26</b></font> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:27</b></font> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:28</b></font> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:29</b></font> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:30</b></font> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:31</b></font> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. <p><p><p><b>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Who will render to every man according to his deeds: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> For there is no respect of persons with God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Their feet are swift to shed blood: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Destruction and misery are in their ways: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And the way of peace have they not known: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> There is no fear of God before their eyes. </font>
