So the house of the LORD was perfected. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </font>
