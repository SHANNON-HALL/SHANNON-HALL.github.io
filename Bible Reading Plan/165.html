Afterward he returned into the land of Judea in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> For he was the high priest's son in law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into a little hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hid men there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> In which doing he committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver him the country and cities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto the tribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might give them silver, and gold, and rewards. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John that his father and brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent to slay thee also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laid hands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; for he knew that they sought to make him away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and worthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he made, and his doings, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Behold, these are written in the chronicles of his priesthood, from the time he was made high priest after his father. <p><p><p><b>The Second Book of the Maccabees</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the land of Judea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypt health and peace: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> God be gracious unto you, and remember his covenant that he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And give you all an heart to serve him, and to do his will, with a good courage and a willing mind; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And open your hearts in his law and commandments, and send you peace, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in time of trouble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And now we be here praying for you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble that came upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed unto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the month Casleu. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people that were at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were in Egypt: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thank him highly, as having been in battle against a king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> For he cast them out that fought within the holy city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army with him that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea by the deceit of Nanea's priests. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into the place, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name of a dowry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he was entered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come in: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones like thunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces, smote off their heads and cast them to those that were without. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up the ungodly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye also might keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire, which was given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had builded the temple and the altar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in an hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it sure, so that the place was unknown to all men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, being sent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of those priests that had hid it to the fire: but when they told us they found no fire, but thick water; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; and when the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with the water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone, which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that every man marvelled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice was consuming, I say, both the priests, and all the rest, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Neemias did. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> The only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, and everlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didst choose the fathers, and sanctify them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> Receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, and preserve thine own portion, and sanctify it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Punish them that oppress us, and with pride do us wrong. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded the water that was left to be poured on the great stones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> So when this matter was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified the sacrifices therewith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried the matter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on those whom he would gratify. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And how that the prophet, having given them the law, charged them not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their hearts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, but they could not find it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory of the Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourably sanctified. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten, it was consumed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> So Solomon kept those eight days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> The same things also were reported in the writings and commentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gathered together the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> In like manner also Judas gathered together all those things that were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send some to fetch them unto you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people, and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and gather us together out of every land under heaven into the holy place: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hath purified the place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: so that, being but a few, they overcame the whole country, and chased barbarous multitudes, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And recovered again the temple renowned all the world over, and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down, the Lord being gracious unto them with all favour: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will assay to abridge in one volume. </font>
