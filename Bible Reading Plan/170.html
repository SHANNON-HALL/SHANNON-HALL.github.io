The hundred and eight and fortieth year, the four and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Now the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochus unto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is, that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one may attend upon his own affairs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> We understand also that the Jews would not consent to our father, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause they require of us, that we should suffer them to live after their own laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest, and we have determined to restore them their temple, that they may live according to the customs of their forefathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grant them peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews was after this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the council, and the rest of the Jews: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in good health. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to return home, and to follow your own business: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct till the thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, as before; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molested for things ignorantly done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing these words: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans, send greeting unto the people of the Jews. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted, therewith we also are well pleased. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> But touching such things as he judged to be referred to the king, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we may declare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to Antioch. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what is your mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about their husbandry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to be quiet and live in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them no hurt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Who accepted of it according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than two hundred of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, he commanded those that were with him to make them ready. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppa. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas' side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable in many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and so they departed to their tents. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> But they that were within it put such trust in the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus' captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded with the points of their own swords. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> So when he had assured them with many words that he would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of their brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provision of engines and darts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> Who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> And it happened that in their fighting together a few of the Jews were slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's company, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself to be their helper and leader of the battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:37</b></font> And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men, he put them to flight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:38</b></font> So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:39</b></font> And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:40</b></font> Now under the coats of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause wherefore they were slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:41</b></font> All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the things that were hid, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:42</b></font> Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:43</b></font> And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:44</b></font> For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:45</b></font> And also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made governor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> But the King of kings moved Antiochus' mind against this wicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man was the cause of all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea, and to put him to death, as the manner is in that place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every side hanged down into the ashes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him unto death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not having so much as burial in the earth; and that most justly: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes. </font>
