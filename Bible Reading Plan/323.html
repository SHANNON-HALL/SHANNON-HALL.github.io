<font size = "+2"><b>323: John 10:19 - John 12:36</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> I and my Father are one. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:37</b></font> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:38</b></font> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:39</b></font> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:40</b></font> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:41</b></font> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:42</b></font> And many believed on him there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> Jesus wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:39</b></font> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:40</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:41</b></font> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:42</b></font> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:43</b></font> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:44</b></font> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:45</b></font> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:46</b></font> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:47</b></font> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:48</b></font> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:49</b></font> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:50</b></font> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:51</b></font> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:52</b></font> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:53</b></font> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:54</b></font> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:55</b></font> And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:56</b></font> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:57</b></font> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> This he said, signifying what death he should die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. </font>
