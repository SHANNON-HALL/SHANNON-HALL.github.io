And the blood shall be forgiven them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

21:19</b></font> Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

(for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> Thou shalt not see the brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

22:3</b></font> In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

22:15</b></font> Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:25</b></font> But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:27</b></font> For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:28</b></font> If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:29</b></font> Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:30</b></font> A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

23:14</b></font> For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

23:19</b></font> Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:21</b></font> When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:22</b></font> But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:23</b></font> That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. </font>
