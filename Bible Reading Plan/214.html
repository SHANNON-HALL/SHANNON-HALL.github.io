11:25</b></font> In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> Like as a partridge taken and kept in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for else thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

12:12</b></font> Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and be pricked therewith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and have no fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than thyself: for how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? for if the one be smitten against the other, it shall be broken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> If thou be for his profit, he will use thee: but if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> If thou have any thing, he will live with thee: yea, he will make thee bare, and will not be sorry for it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> If he have need of thee, he will deceive thee, and smile upon thee, and put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and say, What wantest thou? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And he will shame thee by his meats, until he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at the last he will laugh thee to scorn afterward, when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Beware that thou be not deceived and brought down in thy jollity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> If thou be invited of a mighty man, withdraw thyself, and so much the more will he invite thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Press thou not upon him, lest thou be put back; stand not far off, lest thou be forgotten. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Affect not to be made equal unto him in talk, and believe not his many words: for with much communication will he tempt thee, and smiling upon thee will get out thy secrets: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> But cruelly he will lay up thy words, and will not spare to do thee hurt, and to put thee in prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Observe, and take good heed, for thou walkest in peril of thy overthrowing: when thou hearest these things, awake in thy sleep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Love the Lord all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Every beast loveth his like, and every man loveth his neighbor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man will cleave to his like. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> What fellowship hath the wolf with the lamb? so the sinner with the godly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> What agreement is there between the hyena and a dog? and what peace between the rich and the poor? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> As the wild ass is the lion's prey in the wilderness: so the rich eat up the poor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> As the proud hate humility: so doth the rich abhor the poor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down is thrust away by his friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped, and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> When a rich man speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he saith, they extol it to the clouds: but if the poor man speak, they say, What fellow is this? and if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> Riches are good unto him that hath no sin, and poverty is evil in the mouth of the ungodly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil: and a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity; and the finding out of parables is a wearisome labour of the mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Blessed is the man that hath not slipped with his mouth, and is not pricked with the multitude of sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should an envious man do with money? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> There is none worse than he that envieth himself; and this is a recompence of his wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; and at the last he will declare his wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face, and despiseth men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> A wicked eye envieth his bread, and he is a niggard at his table. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> My son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, and give the Lord his due offering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that the covenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Do good unto thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability stretch out thy hand and give to him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thy labours to be divided by lot? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

14:24</b></font> He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shall not see her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannot remember her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord will prosper it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God love it not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall be given him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knoweth every work of man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works. </font>
