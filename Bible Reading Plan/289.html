1:2</b></font> I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

1:8</b></font> And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

2:4</b></font> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

2:8</b></font> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD. <p><p><p><b>Haggai</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Then spake Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?
