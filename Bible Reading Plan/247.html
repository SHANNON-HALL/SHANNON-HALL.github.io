<font size = "+2"><b>247: Jeremiah 28:1 - Jeremiah 31:9</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:1</b></font> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:2</b></font> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:3</b></font> Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:4</b></font> And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:5</b></font> Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:6</b></font> Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:7</b></font> Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:8</b></font> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:9</b></font> The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:10</b></font> Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:11</b></font> And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:12</b></font> Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:13</b></font> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:14</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:15</b></font> Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:16</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:17</b></font> So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:1</b></font> Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:2</b></font> (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:3</b></font> By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:4</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:5</b></font> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:14</b></font> And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:15</b></font> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:16</b></font> Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:17</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:21</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:22</b></font> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:23</b></font> Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:24</b></font> Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:25</b></font> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:26</b></font> The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:27</b></font> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:28</b></font> For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:29</b></font> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:30</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:31</b></font> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:32</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:2</b></font> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:3</b></font> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:4</b></font> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:5</b></font> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:6</b></font> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:7</b></font> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:8</b></font> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:9</b></font> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:10</b></font> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:11</b></font> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:12</b></font> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:13</b></font> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:14</b></font> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:15</b></font> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:16</b></font> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:17</b></font> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:18</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:19</b></font> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:20</b></font> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:21</b></font> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:22</b></font> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:23</b></font> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:24</b></font> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:1</b></font> At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:3</b></font> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:4</b></font> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. </font>
