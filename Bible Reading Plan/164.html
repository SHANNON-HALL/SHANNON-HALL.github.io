<font size = "+2"><b>164: 1 Maccabees 13:53 - 1 Maccabees 15:37</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:53</b></font> And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get him help to fight against Tryphone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days of Simon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as that evermore his authority and honour pleased them well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that he took Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered the country, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the which he took all uncleaness, neither was there any that resisted him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gave her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them all manner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned unto the end of the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to fray them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Neither was there any left in the land to fight against them: yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of the law and wicked person he took away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of the temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead, they were very sorry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and league which they had made with Judas and Jonathan his brethren: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> Which writings were read before the congregation at Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonians sent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon the high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the people of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified us of your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their coming, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And did register the things that they spake in the council of the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us to renew the friendship they had with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably, and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, to the end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon the high priest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> For he and his brethren and the house of his father have established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from them, and confirmed their liberty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they set upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore and twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, and people, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country, were these things notified unto us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law, Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together with his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the enemies of their nation did their nation great honour: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> (For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nation together, and been their high priest, was added to his people, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them wages, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura, that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all things convenient for the reparation thereof.) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto what glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governor and chief priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:36</b></font> For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that the heathen were taken out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a tower, out of which they issued, and polluted all about the sanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:37</b></font> But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and raised up the walls of Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:38</b></font> King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthood according to those things, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:39</b></font> And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with great honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:40</b></font> For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jews their friends and confederates and brethren; and that they had entertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:41</b></font> Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:42</b></font> Moreover that he should be their captain, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:43</b></font> Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:44</b></font> Also that it should be lawful for none of the people or priests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:45</b></font> And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of these things, he should be punished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:46</b></font> Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to do as hath been said. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:47</b></font> Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:48</b></font> So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:49</b></font> Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Jews, greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> My meaning also being to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be free; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thine hands, let them remain unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it be forgiven thee from this time forth for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we will honour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour, so that your honour shall be known throughout the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus into the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces came together unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora, which lieth by the sea side: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him an hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And when he had compassed the city round about, and joined ships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by land and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome, having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written these things: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> The Jews' ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came unto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their own law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day, assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and much armour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all the covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king's message. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken other men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:36</b></font> But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:37</b></font> In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias. </font>
