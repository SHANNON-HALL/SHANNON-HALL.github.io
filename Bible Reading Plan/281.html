<font size = "+2"><b>281: The Book of Bel and the Dragon (in Daniel) 1:33 - Hosea 6:3</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> But the angel of the Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the lions' den. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again immediately. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face. <p><p><p><b>Hosea</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Then said God, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. </font>
