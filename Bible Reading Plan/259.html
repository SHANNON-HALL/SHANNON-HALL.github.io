This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it.
