And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
