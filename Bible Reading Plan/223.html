48:17</b></font> Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof: he digged the hard rock with iron, and made wells for waters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:18</b></font> In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against Sion, and boasted proudly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:19</b></font> Then trembled their hearts and hands, and they were in pain, as women in travail. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:20</b></font> But they called upon the Lord which is merciful, and stretched out their hands toward him: and immediately the Holy One heard them out of heaven, and delivered them by the ministry of Esay. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:21</b></font> He smote the host of the Assyrians, and his angel destroyed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:22</b></font> For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong in the ways of David his father, as Esay the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, had commanded him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:23</b></font> In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened the king's life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:24</b></font> He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:25</b></font> He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things or ever they came. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:1</b></font> The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honey in all mouths, and as musick at a banquet of wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:2</b></font> He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, and took away the abominations of iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:3</b></font> He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of the ungodly he established the worship of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:4</b></font> All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: for they forsook the law of the most High, even the kings of Juda failed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:5</b></font> Therefore he gave their power unto others, and their glory to a strange nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:6</b></font> They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made the streets desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:7</b></font> For they entreated him evil, who nevertheless was a prophet, sanctified in his mother's womb, that he might root out, and afflict, and destroy; and that he might build up also, and plant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:8</b></font> It was Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, which was shewed him upon the chariot of the cherubims. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:9</b></font> For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of the rain, and directed them that went right. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:10</b></font> And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, and let their bones flourish again out of their place: for they comforted Jacob, and delivered them by assured hope. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:11</b></font> How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right hand: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:12</b></font> So was Jesus the son of Josedec: who in their time builded the house, and set up an holy temple to the Lord, which was prepared for everlasting glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:13</b></font> And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars, and raised up our ruins again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:14</b></font> But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken from the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:15</b></font> Neither was there a young man born like Joseph, a governor of his brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 49:16</b></font> Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adam above every living thing in creation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:1</b></font> Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life repaired the house again, and in his days fortified the temple: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

50:4</b></font> He took care of the temple that it should not fall, and fortified the city against besieging: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:5</b></font> How was he honoured in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:6</b></font> He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:7</b></font> As the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, and as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:8</b></font> And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:9</b></font> As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessel of beaten gold set with all manner of precious stones: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:10</b></font> And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, and as a cypress tree which groweth up to the clouds. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:11</b></font> When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made the garment of holiness honourable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:12</b></font> When he took the portions out of the priests' hands, he himself stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed about, as a young cedar in Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round about. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:13</b></font> So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:14</b></font> And finishing the service at the altar, that he might adorn the offering of the most high Almighty, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:15</b></font> He stretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of the blood of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar a sweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:16</b></font> Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the silver trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance before the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:17</b></font> Then all the people together hasted, and fell down to the earth upon their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty, the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:18</b></font> The singers also sang praises with their voices, with great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:19</b></font> And the people besought the Lord, the most High, by prayer before him that is merciful, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finished his service. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:20</b></font> Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:21</b></font> And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time, that they might receive a blessing from the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:22</b></font> Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which only doeth wondrous things every where, which exalteth our days from the womb, and dealeth with us according to his mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:23</b></font> He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be in our days in Israel for ever: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:24</b></font> That he would confirm his mercy with us, and deliver us at his time! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:25</b></font> There be two manner of nations which my heart abhorreth, and the third is no nation: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:26</b></font> They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, and they that dwell among the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell in Sichem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:27</b></font> Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in this book the instruction of understanding and knowledge, who out of his heart poured forth wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:28</b></font> Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things; and he that layeth them up in his heart shall become wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 50:29</b></font> For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things: for the light of the Lord leadeth him, who giveth wisdom to the godly. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen. <p>A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:1</b></font> I will thank thee, O Lord and King, and praise thee, O God my Saviour: I do give praise unto thy name: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:2</b></font> For thou art my defender and helper, and has preserved my body from destruction, and from the snare of the slanderous tongue, and from the lips that forge lies, and has been mine helper against mine adversaries: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:3</b></font> And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of they mercies and greatness of thy name, from the teeth of them that were ready to devour me, and out of the hands of such as sought after my life, and from the manifold afflictions which I had; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:4</b></font> From the choking of fire on every side, and from the midst of the fire which I kindled not; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:5</b></font> From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue, and from lying words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:6</b></font> By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue my soul drew near even unto death, my life was near to the hell beneath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:7</b></font> They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to help me: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:8</b></font> Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts of old, how thou deliverest such as wait for thee, and savest them out of the hands of the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:9</b></font> Then lifted I up my supplications from the earth, and prayed for deliverance from death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:10</b></font> I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the days of my trouble, and in the time of the proud, when there was no help. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:11</b></font> I will praise thy name continually, and will sing praises with thanksgiving; and so my prayer was heard: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:12</b></font> For thou savedst me from destruction, and deliveredst me from the evil time: therefore will I give thanks, and praise thee, and bless they name, O Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:13</b></font> When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad, I desired wisdom openly in my prayer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:14</b></font> I prayed for her before the temple, and will seek her out even to the end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:15</b></font> Even from the flower till the grape was ripe hath my heart delighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up sought I after her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:16</b></font> I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, and gat much learning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:17</b></font> I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe glory unto him that giveth me wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:18</b></font> For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followed that which is good; so shall I not be confounded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:19</b></font> My soul hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I was exact: I stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed my ignorances of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:20</b></font> I directed my soul unto her, and I found her in pureness: I have had my heart joined with her from the beginning, therefore shall I not be foresaken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:21</b></font> My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have I gotten a good possession. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:22</b></font> The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward, and I will praise him therewith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:23</b></font> Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, and dwell in the house of learning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:24</b></font> Wherefore are ye slow, and what say ye to these things, seeing your souls are very thirsty?
