<font size = "+2"><b>362: Revelation 8:1 - Revelation 12:17</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. </font>
