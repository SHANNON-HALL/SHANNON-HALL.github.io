<font size = "+2"><b>71: Joshua 22:7 - Joshua 24:25</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:25</b></font> For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:27</b></font> But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:28</b></font> Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:29</b></font> God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:30</b></font> And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:31</b></font> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:32</b></font> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:33</b></font> And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:34</b></font> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the names of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. </font>
