And all the people said; So be it, so be it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my brethren, and take this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your walls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursue them, and overthrow them as they go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> But before ye do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite, that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to us as it were to his death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and when he was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand in the assembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his spirit failed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet, and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the tabernacles of Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy name shall be astonished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> Now therefore tell me all the things that thou hast done in these days. Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of the people all that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hour she spake unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they went forth by bands unto the straits of the mountain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders, which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of their rulers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent; for he thought that he had slept with Judith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> But because none answered, he opened it, and went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his head was taken from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and sighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of the Hebrews hath brought shame upon the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for, behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a head. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard these words, they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled, and there was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And when they that were in the tents heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was no man that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out all together, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hill country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> They also that had camped in the mountains round about Bethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one that was a warrior among them, rushed out upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Cola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the things that were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies to destroy them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter had that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were in the mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for the multitude was very great. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the children of Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And when they came unto her, they blessed her with one accord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem, thou art the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicing of our nation: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Thou hast done all these things by thine hand: thou hast done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be thou of the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days: and they gave unto Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, and beds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it on her mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, and blessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branches in her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang after her this song of praise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing unto my Lord with cymbals: tune unto him a new psalm: exalt him, and call upon his name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in the midst of the people he hath delivered me out of the hands of them that persecuted me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came with ten thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped the torrents, and their horsemen have covered the hills. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to deceive him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but they were overthrown. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art great and glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and they were made, thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, and there is none that can resist thy voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yet thou art merciful to them that fear thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but he that feareth the Lord is great at all times. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshipped the Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> After this time every one returned to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was in her time honourable in all the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of her life, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred. </font>
