<font size = "+2"><b>276: Daniel 3:19 - Daniel 5:24</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Then was Daniel brought in before the king.
