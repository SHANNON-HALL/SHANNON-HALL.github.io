<font size = "+2"><b>230: Isaiah 29:18 - Isaiah 33:24</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:21</b></font> That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:22</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:2</b></font> That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:3</b></font> Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:4</b></font> For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:5</b></font> They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:6</b></font> The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:7</b></font> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:8</b></font> Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:9</b></font> That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:10</b></font> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:13</b></font> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:14</b></font> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:15</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:16</b></font> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:17</b></font> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:19</b></font> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:20</b></font> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:21</b></font> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:22</b></font> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:23</b></font> Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:24</b></font> The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:25</b></font> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:26</b></font> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:27</b></font> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:28</b></font> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:29</b></font> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:30</b></font> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:31</b></font> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:32</b></font> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:33</b></font> For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:1</b></font> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:2</b></font> Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
