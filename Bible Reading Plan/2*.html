7:7</b></font> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And God spake unto Noah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. </font>
