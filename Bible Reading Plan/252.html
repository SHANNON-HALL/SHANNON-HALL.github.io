<font size = "+2"><b>252: Jeremiah 42:19 - Jeremiah 46:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:19</b></font> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:20</b></font> For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:21</b></font> And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:22</b></font> Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:2</b></font> Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:3</b></font> But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:4</b></font> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:5</b></font> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:6</b></font> Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:7</b></font> So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:8</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:9</b></font> Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:10</b></font> And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:11</b></font> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:12</b></font> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:13</b></font> He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:3</b></font> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:4</b></font> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:5</b></font> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:6</b></font> Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:7</b></font> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:8</b></font> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:9</b></font> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:10</b></font> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:11</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:12</b></font> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:13</b></font> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:14</b></font> So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:15</b></font> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:16</b></font> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:17</b></font> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:18</b></font> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:19</b></font> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:20</b></font> Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:21</b></font> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:22</b></font> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:23</b></font> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:24</b></font> Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:25</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:26</b></font> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:27</b></font> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:28</b></font> Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:29</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:30</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:1</b></font> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:3</b></font> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:4</b></font> Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:5</b></font> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:1</b></font> The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:2</b></font> Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:3</b></font> Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:4</b></font> Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:5</b></font> Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:6</b></font> Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:7</b></font> Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:8</b></font> Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:9</b></font> Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:10</b></font> For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:11</b></font> Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:12</b></font> The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:13</b></font> The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:14</b></font> Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:15</b></font> Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:16</b></font> He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:17</b></font> They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:18</b></font> As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:19</b></font> O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:20</b></font> Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:21</b></font> Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:22</b></font> The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:23</b></font> They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:24</b></font> The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:25</b></font> The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:26</b></font> And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD. </font>
