<font size = "+2"><b>320: John 4:1 - John 6:14</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And he must needs go through Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> And many more believed because of his own word; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:45</b></font> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:46</b></font> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:47</b></font> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:48</b></font> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:49</b></font> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:50</b></font> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:51</b></font> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:52</b></font> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:53</b></font> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:54</b></font> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:40</b></font> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:41</b></font> I receive not honour from men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:42</b></font> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:43</b></font> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:44</b></font> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:45</b></font> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:46</b></font> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:47</b></font> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. </font>
