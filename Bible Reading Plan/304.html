And there were also with him other little ships. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:40</b></font> And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:41</b></font> And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:42</b></font> And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:43</b></font> And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And they went out, and preached that men should repent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:38</b></font> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:39</b></font> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:40</b></font> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:41</b></font> And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:42</b></font> And they did all eat, and were filled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:43</b></font> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:44</b></font> And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:45</b></font> And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:46</b></font> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:47</b></font> And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:48</b></font> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:49</b></font> But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:50</b></font> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:51</b></font> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:52</b></font> For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:53</b></font> And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:54</b></font> And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:55</b></font> And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:56</b></font> And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. </font>
