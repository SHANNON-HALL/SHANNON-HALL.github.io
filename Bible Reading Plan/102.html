So was he seven years in building it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:39</b></font> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:40</b></font> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:41</b></font> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:42</b></font> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:43</b></font> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:44</b></font> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:45</b></font> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:46</b></font> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:47</b></font> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:48</b></font> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:49</b></font> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:50</b></font> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:51</b></font> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. </font>
