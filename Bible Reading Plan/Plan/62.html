28:53</b></font> And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:54</b></font> So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:55</b></font> So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:56</b></font> The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:57</b></font> And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:58</b></font> If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:59</b></font> Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:60</b></font> Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:61</b></font> Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:62</b></font> And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:63</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:64</b></font> And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:65</b></font> And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:66</b></font> And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:67</b></font> In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:68</b></font> And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:1</b></font> These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:2</b></font> And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:3</b></font> The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:4</b></font> Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:5</b></font> And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:14</b></font> Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:15</b></font> But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:16</b></font> (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:17</b></font> And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:21</b></font> And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:22</b></font> So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:23</b></font> And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:24</b></font> Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:25</b></font> Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:26</b></font> For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:27</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:28</b></font> And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:29</b></font> The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </font>
