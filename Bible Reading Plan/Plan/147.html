Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit's. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve. <p><p><p><b>The Book of Judith</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, which reigned over the Medes in Ecbatane, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundred cubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in array of his footmen: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hill country, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, and the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations of the sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all that dwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those that dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all that dwelt upon the sea coast, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, and Galaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, and the river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> But all the inhabitants of the land made light of the commandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went they with him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he was before them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from them without effect, and with disgrace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all this country, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, and that he would slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till ye come to the borders of the two seas. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Then he marched in battle array with his power against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: for he overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his chariots, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smote him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all his company of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, an hundred and twenty days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey the commandment of his mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which was next unto him, and said unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth, Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with thee men that trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twenty thousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And thou shalt go against all the west country, because they disobeyed my commandment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earth and water: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of mine army, and I will give them for a spoil unto them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks and the river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Thou therefore shalt go forth. and take beforehand for me all their coasts: and if they will yield themselves unto thee, thou shalt reserve them for me till the day of their punishment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them; but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thou goest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever I have spoken, that will I do by mine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And take thou heed that thou transgress none of the commandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I have commanded thee, and defer not to do them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors and captains, and the officers of the army of Assur; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lord had commanded him, unto an hundred and twenty thousand, and twelve thousand archers on horseback; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a very great number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and very much gold and silver out of the king's house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Then he went forth and all his power to go before king Nabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> A great number also sundry countries came with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was without number. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen and chariots, and went from thence into the hill country; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness at the south of the land of the Chellians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, till ye come to the sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, over against Arabia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned up their tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time of wheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed their flocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wasted their countries, and smote all their young men with the edge of the sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all the inhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan; and they that dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king lie before thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields of wheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tents lie before thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are thy servants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto him after this manner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen men for aid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> So they and all the country round about received them with garlands, with dances, and with timbrels. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down their groves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, that all nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all tongues and tribes should call upon him as god. </font>
