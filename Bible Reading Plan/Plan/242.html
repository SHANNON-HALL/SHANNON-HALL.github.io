<font size = "+2"><b>242: Jeremiah 11:1 - Jeremiah 14:12</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. </font>
