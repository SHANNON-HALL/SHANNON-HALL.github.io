Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. </font>
