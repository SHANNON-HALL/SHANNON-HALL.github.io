Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:21</b></font> And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth- shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:27</b></font> Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:28</b></font> And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal.
