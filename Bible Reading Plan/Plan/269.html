<font size = "+2"><b>269: Ezekiel 33:1 - Ezekiel 35:15</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:1</b></font> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:2</b></font> Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:12</b></font> Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:13</b></font> When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:21</b></font> And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:22</b></font> Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:23</b></font> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:24</b></font> Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:25</b></font> Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:26</b></font> Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:27</b></font> Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:28</b></font> For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:29</b></font> Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:30</b></font> Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:31</b></font> And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:32</b></font> And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:33</b></font> And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:1</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:13</b></font> And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:14</b></font> I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:15</b></font> I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:16</b></font> I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:17</b></font> And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:18</b></font> Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:19</b></font> And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:20</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:21</b></font> Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:22</b></font> Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:23</b></font> And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:24</b></font> And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:25</b></font> And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:26</b></font> And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:27</b></font> And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:28</b></font> And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:29</b></font> And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:30</b></font> Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:31</b></font> And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:1</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:2</b></font> Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:3</b></font> And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:4</b></font> I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:5</b></font> Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:6</b></font> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:7</b></font> Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:8</b></font> And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:9</b></font> I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:10</b></font> Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:11</b></font> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:12</b></font> And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:13</b></font> Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:14</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:15</b></font> As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD. </font>
