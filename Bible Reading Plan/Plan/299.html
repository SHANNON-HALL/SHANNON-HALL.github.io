<font size = "+2"><b>299: Matthew 18:21 - Matthew 21:22</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:35</b></font> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:27</b></font> And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:28</b></font> Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:29</b></font> And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:30</b></font> And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:31</b></font> And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:32</b></font> And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:33</b></font> They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:34</b></font> So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:22</b></font> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. </font>
