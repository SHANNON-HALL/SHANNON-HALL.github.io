And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.

And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. </font>
