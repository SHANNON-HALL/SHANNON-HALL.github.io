<font size = "+2"><b>255: Jeremiah 51:59 - Lamentations 2:19</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:59</b></font> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:60</b></font> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:61</b></font> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:62</b></font> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:63</b></font> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 51:64</b></font> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:1</b></font> Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:2</b></font> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:3</b></font> For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:4</b></font> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:5</b></font> So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:6</b></font> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:7</b></font> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:8</b></font> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:9</b></font> Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:10</b></font> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:11</b></font> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:12</b></font> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:13</b></font> And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:14</b></font> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:15</b></font> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:16</b></font> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:17</b></font> Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:18</b></font> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:19</b></font> And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:20</b></font> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:21</b></font> And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 52:22</b></font> And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass.
