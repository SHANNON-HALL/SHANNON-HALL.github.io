<font size = "+2"><b>248: Jeremiah 31:10 - Jeremiah 32:44</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:14</b></font> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:15</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:16</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:17</b></font> And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:18</b></font> I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:19</b></font> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:20</b></font> Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:21</b></font> Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:22</b></font> How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:23</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:24</b></font> And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:25</b></font> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:26</b></font> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:27</b></font> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:28</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:29</b></font> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:30</b></font> But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:31</b></font> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:32</b></font> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:33</b></font> But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:34</b></font> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:35</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:36</b></font> If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:37</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:38</b></font> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:39</b></font> And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:40</b></font> And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:6</b></font> And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:7</b></font> Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:8</b></font> So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:9</b></font> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:10</b></font> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:11</b></font> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:12</b></font> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:13</b></font> And I charged Baruch before them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:14</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:15</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:16</b></font> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:17</b></font> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:18</b></font> Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:19</b></font> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:20</b></font> Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:21</b></font> And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:22</b></font> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:23</b></font> And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:24</b></font> Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:25</b></font> And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:26</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:27</b></font> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:28</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:29</b></font> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:30</b></font> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:31</b></font> For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:32</b></font> Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:33</b></font> And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:34</b></font> But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:35</b></font> And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:36</b></font> And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:37</b></font> Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:38</b></font> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:39</b></font> And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:40</b></font> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:41</b></font> Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:42</b></font> For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:43</b></font> And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:44</b></font> Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD. </font>
