There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul?
