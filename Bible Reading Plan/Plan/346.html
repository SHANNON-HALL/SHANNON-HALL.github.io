Amen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And they glorified God in me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. </font>
