And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:35</b></font> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:36</b></font> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:37</b></font> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:38</b></font> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:39</b></font> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:40</b></font> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:41</b></font> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:42</b></font> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:43</b></font> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:44</b></font> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:45</b></font> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:46</b></font> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. </font>
