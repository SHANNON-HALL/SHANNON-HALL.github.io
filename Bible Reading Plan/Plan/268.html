31:2</b></font> Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:3</b></font> Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:4</b></font> The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:14</b></font> To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:15</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:16</b></font> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:17</b></font> They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:18</b></font> To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:6</b></font> I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:7</b></font> And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:8</b></font> All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:9</b></font> I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:10</b></font> Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:11</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:12</b></font> By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:13</b></font> I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:14</b></font> Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:15</b></font> When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:16</b></font> This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:17</b></font> It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:18</b></font> Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:19</b></font> Whom dost thou pass in beauty?
