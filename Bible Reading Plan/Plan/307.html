<font size = "+2"><b>307: Mark 12:13 - Mark 14:42</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:37</b></font> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:38</b></font> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:39</b></font> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:40</b></font> Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:41</b></font> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:42</b></font> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:43</b></font> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:44</b></font> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And the gospel must first be published among all nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:36</b></font> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:37</b></font> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:38</b></font> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:39</b></font> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:40</b></font> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:41</b></font> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:42</b></font> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. </font>
