<font size = "+2"><b>325: John 16:1 - John 18:40</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Of sin, because they believe not on me; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:32</b></font> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:33</b></font> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:35</b></font> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:36</b></font> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:37</b></font> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:38</b></font> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:39</b></font> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:40</b></font> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. </font>
