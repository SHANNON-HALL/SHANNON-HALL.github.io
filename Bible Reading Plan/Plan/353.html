And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> But to which of the angels said he at any times, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.

And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. </font>
