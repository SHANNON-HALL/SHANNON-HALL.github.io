<font size = "+2"><b>55: Deuteronomy 4:41 - Deuteronomy 7:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:45</b></font> These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:46</b></font> On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:47</b></font> And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:48</b></font> From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:49</b></font> And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Thou shalt have none other gods before me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Thou shalt not kill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Neither shalt thou commit adultery. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Neither shalt thou steal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. </font>
