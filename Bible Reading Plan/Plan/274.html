<font size = "+2"><b>274: Ezekiel 46:16 - Daniel 1:7</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:16</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:17</b></font> But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:18</b></font> Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:19</b></font> After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:20</b></font> Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:21</b></font> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:22</b></font> In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:23</b></font> And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:24</b></font> Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:1</b></font> Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:2</b></font> Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:3</b></font> And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ancles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:4</b></font> Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:5</b></font> Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:6</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:7</b></font> Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:8</b></font> Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:9</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:10</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:11</b></font> But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:12</b></font> And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:13</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:14</b></font> And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:15</b></font> And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:16</b></font> Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:17</b></font> And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
