<font size = "+2"><b>328: Acts of the Apostles 4:5 - Acts of the Apostles 7:36</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:40</b></font> And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:41</b></font> And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:42</b></font> And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Then said the high priest, Are these things so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. </font>
