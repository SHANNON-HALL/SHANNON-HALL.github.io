<font size = "+2"><b>199: Proverbs 9:13 - Proverbs 14:35</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> To call passengers who go right on their ways: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repaid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame. </font>
