<font size = "+2"><b>210: Wisdom 14:21 - Wisdom 18:11</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by the multitude of beasts tormented. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thine own people, thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste, even quails to stir up their appetite: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> To the end that they, desiring food, might for the ugly sight of the beasts sent among them lothe even that, which they must needs desire; but these, suffering penury for a short space, might be made partakers of a strange taste. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyranny should come penury, which they could not avoid: but to these it should only be shewed how their enemies were tormented. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these, and they perished with the stings of crooked serpents, thy wrath endured not for ever: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> But they were troubled for a small season, that they might be admonished, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> And in this thou madest thine enemies confess, that it is thou who deliverest from all evil: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed, neither was there found any remedy for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragons overcame: for thy mercy was ever by them, and healed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words; and were quickly saved, that not falling into deep forgetfulness, they might be continually mindful of thy goodness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, that restored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to the gates of hell, and bringest up again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> A man indeed killeth through his malice: and the spirit, when it is gone forth, returneth not; neither the soul received up cometh again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> But it is not possible to escape thine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> For the ungodly, that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thine arm: with strange rains, hails, and showers, were they persecuted, that they could not avoid, and through fire were they consumed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> For, which is most to be wondered at, the fire had more force in the water, that quencheth all things: for the world fighteth for the righteous. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> For sometime the flame was mitigated, that it might not burn up the beasts that were sent against the ungodly; but themselves might see and perceive that they were persecuted with the judgment of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> And at another time it burneth even in the midst of water above the power of fire, that it might destroy the fruits of an unjust land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels' food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to every man's liking. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not, that they might know that fire burning in the hail, and sparkling in the rain, did destroy the fruits of the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> But this again did even forget his own strength, that the righteous might be nourished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Maker increaseth his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had need: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know, that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that it is thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> For that which was not destroyed of the fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, soon melted away: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's hoar frost, and shall run away as unprofitable water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay there exiled from the eternal providence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with strange apparitions. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light, whose voice they hearing, and not seeing their shape, because they also had not suffered the same things, they counted them happy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> But for that they did not hurt them now, of whom they had been wronged before, they thanked them, and besought them pardon for that they had been enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire, both to be a guide of the unknown journey, and an harmless sun to entertain them honourably. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> For they were worthy to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness, who had kept thy sons shut up, by whom the uncorrupt light of the law was to be given unto the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterwards be of good cheer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous, and destruction of the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> The master and the servant were punished after one manner; and like as the king, so suffered the common person. </font>
