But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. <p><p><p><b>The Second Book of Samuel Otherwise Called the Second Book of the Kings</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou?

And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.

And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. </font>
