And they said, We know him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.
