40:12</b></font> All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out: but true dealing shall endure for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:13</b></font> The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, and shall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in rain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:14</b></font> While he openeth his hand he shall rejoice: so shall transgressors come to nought. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:15</b></font> The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches: but are as unclean roots upon a hard rock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:16</b></font> The weed growing upon every water and bank of a river shall be pulled up before all grass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:17</b></font> Bountifulness is as a most fruitful garden, and mercifulness endureth for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:18</b></font> To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a sweet life: but he that findeth a treasure is above them both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:19</b></font> Children and the building of a city continue a man's name: but a blameless wife is counted above them both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:20</b></font> Wine and musick rejoice the heart: but the love of wisdom is above them both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:21</b></font> The pipe and the psaltery make sweet melody: but a pleasant tongue is above them both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:22</b></font> Thine eye desireth favour and beauty: but more than both corn while it is green. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:23</b></font> A friend and companion never meet amiss: but above both is a wife with her husband. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

40:26</b></font> Riches and strength lift up the heart: but the fear of the Lord is above them both: there is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek help. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:27</b></font> The fear of the Lord is a fruitful garden, and covereth him above all glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:28</b></font> My son, lead not a beggar's life; for better it is to die than to beg. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:29</b></font> The life of him that dependeth on another man's table is not to be counted for a life; for he polluteth himself with other men's meat: but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:30</b></font> Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless: but in his belly there shall burn a fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:1</b></font> O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions, unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperity in all things: yea, unto him that is yet able to receive meat! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:2</b></font> O death, acceptable is thy sentence unto the needy, and unto him whose strength faileth, that is now in the last age, and is vexed with all things, and to him that despaireth, and hath lost patience! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:3</b></font> Fear not the sentence of death, remember them that have been before thee, and that come after; for this is the sentence of the Lord over all flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:4</b></font> And why art thou against the pleasure of the most High? there is no inquisition in the grave, whether thou have lived ten, or an hundred, or a thousand years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:5</b></font> The children of sinners are abominable children, and they that are conversant in the dwelling of the ungodly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:6</b></font> The inheritance of sinners' children shall perish, and their posterity shall have a perpetual reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:7</b></font> The children will complain of an ungodly father, because they shall be reproached for his sake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:8</b></font> Woe be unto you, ungodly men, which have forsaken the law of the most high God! for if ye increase, it shall be to your destruction: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:9</b></font> And if ye be born, ye shall be born to a curse: and if ye die, a curse shall be your portion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:10</b></font> All that are of the earth shall turn to earth again: so the ungodly shall go from a curse to destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:11</b></font> The mourning of men is about their bodies: but an ill name of sinners shall be blotted out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:12</b></font> Have regard to thy name; for that shall continue with thee above a thousand great treasures of gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:13</b></font> A good life hath but few days: but a good name endureth for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:14</b></font> My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is in them both? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:15</b></font> A man that hideth his foolishness is better than a man that hideth his wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:16</b></font> Therefore be shamefaced according to my word: for it is not good to retain all shamefacedness; neither is it altogether approved in every thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:17</b></font> Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother: and of a lie before a prince and a mighty man; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:18</b></font> Of an offence before a judge and ruler; of iniquity before a congregation and people; of unjust dealing before thy partner and friend; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:19</b></font> And of theft in regard of the place where thou sojournest, and in regard of the truth of God and his covenant; and to lean with thine elbow upon the meat; and of scorning to give and take; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:20</b></font> And of silence before them that salute thee; and to look upon an harlot; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:21</b></font> And to turn away thy face from thy kinsman; or to take away a portion or a gift; or to gaze upon another man's wife. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:22</b></font> Or to be overbusy with his maid, and come not near her bed; or of upbraiding speeches before friends; and after thou hast given, upbraid not; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:23</b></font> Or of iterating and speaking again that which thou hast heard; and of revealing of secrets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:24</b></font> So shalt thou be truly shamefaced and find favour before all men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:1</b></font> Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:2</b></font> Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:3</b></font> Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:4</b></font> Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:5</b></font> And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:6</b></font> Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:7</b></font> Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:8</b></font> Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of all men living. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:9</b></font> The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:10</b></font> In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:11</b></font> Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:12</b></font> Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst of women. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:13</b></font> For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:14</b></font> Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:15</b></font> I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:16</b></font> The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:17</b></font> The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be established for his glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:18</b></font> He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:19</b></font> He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:20</b></font> No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:21</b></font> He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:22</b></font> Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:23</b></font> All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:24</b></font> All things are double one against another: and he hath made nothing imperfect. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:25</b></font> One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding his glory? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:1</b></font> The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:2</b></font> The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of the most High: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:3</b></font> At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:4</b></font> A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:5</b></font> Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:6</b></font> He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:7</b></font> From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:8</b></font> The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:9</b></font> The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:10</b></font> At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:11</b></font> Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:12</b></font> It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:13</b></font> By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:14</b></font> Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:15</b></font> By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:16</b></font> At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:17</b></font> The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:18</b></font> The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:19</b></font> The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:20</b></font> When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:21</b></font> It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:22</b></font> A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:23</b></font> By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:24</b></font> They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:25</b></font> For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales created. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:26</b></font> By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:27</b></font> We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:28</b></font> How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:29</b></font> The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is his power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:30</b></font> When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:31</b></font> Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:32</b></font> There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:33</b></font> For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:1</b></font> Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:2</b></font> The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his great power from the beginning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:3</b></font> Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaring prophecies: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:4</b></font> Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are their instructions: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:5</b></font> Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:6</b></font> Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their habitations: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:7</b></font> All these were honoured in their generations, and were the glory of their times. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:8</b></font> There be of them, that have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:9</b></font> And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they had never been; and are become as though they had never been born; and their children after them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:10</b></font> But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath not been forgotten. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:11</b></font> With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance, and their children are within the covenant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:12</b></font> Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:13</b></font> Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall not be blotted out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:14</b></font> Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:15</b></font> The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will shew forth their praise. </font>
