<font size = "+2"><b>316: Luke 18:1 - Luke 20:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:35</b></font> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:36</b></font> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:37</b></font> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:38</b></font> And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:39</b></font> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:40</b></font> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:41</b></font> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:42</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:43</b></font> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:31</b></font> And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:32</b></font> And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:33</b></font> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:34</b></font> And they said, The Lord hath need of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:35</b></font> And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:36</b></font> And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:37</b></font> And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:38</b></font> Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:39</b></font> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:40</b></font> And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:41</b></font> And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:42</b></font> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:43</b></font> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:44</b></font> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:45</b></font> And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:46</b></font> Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:47</b></font> And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:48</b></font> And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. </font>
