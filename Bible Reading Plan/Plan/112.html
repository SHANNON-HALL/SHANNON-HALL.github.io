<font size = "+2"><b>112: 2 Kings 7:12 - 2 Kings 9:37</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:33</b></font> And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:34</b></font> And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:35</b></font> And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:36</b></font> Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:37</b></font> And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel. </font>
