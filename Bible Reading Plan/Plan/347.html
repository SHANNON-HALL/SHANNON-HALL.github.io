<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> I would they were even cut off which trouble you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> For every man shall bear his own burden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

1:23</b></font> Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

2:10</b></font> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

(as I wrote afore in few words, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
