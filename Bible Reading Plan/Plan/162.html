<font size = "+2"><b>162: 1 Maccabees 10:83 - 1 Maccabees 12:11</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:83</b></font> The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for safety. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:84</b></font> But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:85</b></font> Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigh eight thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:86</b></font> And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with great pomp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:87</b></font> After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem, having any spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:88</b></font> Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:89</b></font> And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the king's blood: he gave him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it to his own. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner, so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother in law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy father's kingdom: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he sought to slay me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent it unto Ptolemee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were slain one of another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favour in his sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this manner: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:39</b></font> Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander's part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:40</b></font> And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:41</b></font> In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:42</b></font> So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:43</b></font> Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:44</b></font> Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:45</b></font> Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:46</b></font> Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:47</b></font> Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:48</b></font> Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day, and delivered the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:49</b></font> So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:50</b></font> Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:51</b></font> With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:52</b></font> So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:53</b></font> Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:54</b></font> After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:55</b></font> Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:56</b></font> Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:57</b></font> At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king's friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:58</b></font> Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:59</b></font> His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:60</b></font> Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:61</b></font> From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:62</b></font> Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country unto Damascus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:63</b></font> Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:64</b></font> He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:65</b></font> Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:66</b></font> But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:67</b></font> As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to the plain of Nasor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:68</b></font> And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:69</b></font> So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:70</b></font> Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of the host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:71</b></font> Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:72</b></font> Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:73</b></font> Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:74</b></font> So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent us unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye had with them, and league, as in former time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors of every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea peaceably. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that ye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent honourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers unto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye sent unto us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becometh us to think upon our brethren: </font>
