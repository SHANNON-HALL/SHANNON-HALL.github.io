<font size = "+2"><b>45: Numbers 13:17 - Numbers 15:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

14:31</b></font> But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:36</b></font> And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:37</b></font> Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:38</b></font> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:39</b></font> And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:40</b></font> And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:41</b></font> And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:42</b></font> Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:43</b></font> For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:44</b></font> But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:45</b></font> Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

15:15</b></font> One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
