<font size = "+2"><b>150: Judith 10:2 - Judith 13:4</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, and went down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days, and in her feast days, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses her husband. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all men that should see her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with fine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris and Charmis. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, and said unto her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, and accomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to be opened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of any one of his men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to his hands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreat thee well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort, fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountains had not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them: but they have done these things to themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of good comfort, thou shalt live this night, and hereafter: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they do the servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant, and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I will declare no lie to my lord this night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God will bring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall not fail of his purposes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth liveth, and as his power liveth, who hath sent thee for the upholding of every living thing: for not only men shall serve him by thee, but also the beasts of the field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the air, shall live by thy power under Nabuchodonosor and all his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it is reported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in all the kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thy council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; but lay it up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not be punished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sin against their God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of his purpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hath overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger whensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant, and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposed to consume all those things, that God hath forbidden them to eat by his laws: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenths of wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith do it, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the same day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled from their presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee, whereat all the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shall hear it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heaven day and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee, and thy servant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And I will come and shew it unto thee: then thou shalt go forth with all thine army, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And I will lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thou come before Jerusalem; and I will set thy throne in the midst thereof; and thou shalt drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dog shall not so much as open his mouth at thee: for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, and they were declared unto me, and I am sent to tell thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; and they marvelled at her wisdom, and said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to the other, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well to send thee before the people, that strength might be in our hands and destruction upon them that lightly regard my lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, and witty in thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renowned through the whole earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set; and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and that she should drink of his own wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be an offence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I have brought. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail, how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us of thy nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thine handmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord work by mine hand the things that he hath determined. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward the morning watch, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command that thine handmaid may go forth unto prayer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the raising up of the children of her people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she did eat her meat at evening. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his own servants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over all that he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which is with thee, that she come unto us, and eat and drink with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her not unto us, she will laugh us to scorn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and came to her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry with us and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, which serve in the house of Nabuchodonosor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I should gainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will do speedily, and it shall be my joy unto the day of my death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the ground for her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas far her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heart was ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatly her company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that he had seen her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank more wine than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waiters from the presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for they were all weary, because the feast had been long. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without her bedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: for she said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same purpose. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber, neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works of mine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. </font>
