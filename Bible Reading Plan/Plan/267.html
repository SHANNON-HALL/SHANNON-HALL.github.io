the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail;

28:2</b></font> Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:3</b></font> Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:4</b></font> With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:5</b></font> By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:6</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:7</b></font> Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:8</b></font> They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:9</b></font> Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:10</b></font> Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:11</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:12</b></font> Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:13</b></font> Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:14</b></font> Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:15</b></font> Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:16</b></font> By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:17</b></font> Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:18</b></font> Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:19</b></font> All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:20</b></font> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:21</b></font> Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:22</b></font> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:23</b></font> For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her street; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:24</b></font> And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:25</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:26</b></font> And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:1</b></font> In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:2</b></font> Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:3</b></font> Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:4</b></font> But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:5</b></font> And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:14</b></font> And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:15</b></font> It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:16</b></font> And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:17</b></font> And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD. </font>
