<font size = "+2"><b>97: 2 Samuel 18:9 - 2 Samuel 20:2</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:31</b></font> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:32</b></font> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:33</b></font> And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:34</b></font> And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:35</b></font> I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:36</b></font> Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:37</b></font> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:38</b></font> And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:39</b></font> And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:40</b></font> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:41</b></font> And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:42</b></font> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:43</b></font> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. </font>
