<font size = "+2"><b>273: Ezekiel 44:1 - Ezekiel 46:15</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:1</b></font> Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:2</b></font> Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:3</b></font> It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:4</b></font> Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:5</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:6</b></font> And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:7</b></font> In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:8</b></font> And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:9</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:10</b></font> And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:11</b></font> Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:12</b></font> Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:13</b></font> And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:14</b></font> But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:15</b></font> But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:16</b></font> They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:17</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:18</b></font> They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:19</b></font> And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:20</b></font> Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:21</b></font> Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:22</b></font> Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:23</b></font> And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:24</b></font> And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:25</b></font> And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:26</b></font> And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:27</b></font> And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:28</b></font> And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:29</b></font> They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:30</b></font> And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:2</b></font> Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:3</b></font> And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:4</b></font> The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:5</b></font> And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:6</b></font> And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:7</b></font> And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:8</b></font> In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:9</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:10</b></font> Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

for ten baths are an homer: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:15</b></font> And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:16</b></font> All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:17</b></font> And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:18</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:19</b></font> And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:20</b></font> And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:21</b></font> In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:22</b></font> And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:23</b></font> And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:24</b></font> And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:25</b></font> In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:1</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:2</b></font> And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:3</b></font> Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:4</b></font> And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:5</b></font> And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:6</b></font> And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:7</b></font> And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:8</b></font> And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:9</b></font> But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:10</b></font> And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:11</b></font> And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:12</b></font> Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:13</b></font> Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:14</b></font> And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:15</b></font> Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering. </font>
