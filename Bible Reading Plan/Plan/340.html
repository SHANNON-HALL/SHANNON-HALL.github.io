where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> That no flesh should glory in his presence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.

If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? </font>
