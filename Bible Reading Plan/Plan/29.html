39:4</b></font> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:5</b></font> And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:6</b></font> And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:7</b></font> And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:8</b></font> And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:9</b></font> It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:10</b></font> And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:11</b></font> And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

39:14</b></font> And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:15</b></font> And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:16</b></font> And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:17</b></font> And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:18</b></font> And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:19</b></font> And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:20</b></font> And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:21</b></font> And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:22</b></font> And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:23</b></font> And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:24</b></font> And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:25</b></font> And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:26</b></font> A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:27</b></font> And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:28</b></font> And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:29</b></font> And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:30</b></font> And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:31</b></font> And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:32</b></font> Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:33</b></font> And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:34</b></font> And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

39:41</b></font> The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:42</b></font> According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:43</b></font> And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they have done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:2</b></font> On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:3</b></font> And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:4</b></font> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:5</b></font> And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:6</b></font> And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:7</b></font> And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:8</b></font> And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:9</b></font> And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:10</b></font> And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:11</b></font> And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:12</b></font> And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:13</b></font> And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:14</b></font> And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:15</b></font> And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:16</b></font> Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:17</b></font> And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:20</b></font> And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
