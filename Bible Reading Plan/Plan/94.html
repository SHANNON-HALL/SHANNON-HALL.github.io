<font size = "+2"><b>94: 2 Samuel 11:1 - 2 Samuel 13:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. </font>
