<font size = "+2"><b>153: Esther 4:10 - Esther 9:11</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. </font>
