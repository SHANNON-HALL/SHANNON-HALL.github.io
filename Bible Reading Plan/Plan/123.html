And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:32</b></font> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:33</b></font> Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:34</b></font> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:35</b></font> And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:36</b></font> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:37</b></font> So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:38</b></font> And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:39</b></font> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:40</b></font> To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:41</b></font> And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:42</b></font> And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:43</b></font> And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. </font>
