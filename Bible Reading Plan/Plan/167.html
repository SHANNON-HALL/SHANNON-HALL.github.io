<font size = "+2"><b>167: 2 Maccabees 4:33 - 2 Maccabees 6:30</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> And when the king was come again from the places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain without cause. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that was dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading him through the whole city unto that very place, where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit thereof was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began first to offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in years, and no less in folly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of them caught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that was next at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those that set upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to the ground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for the churchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laid against Menelaus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sent from the senate pleaded the cause before him: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:45</b></font> But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the king toward him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:46</b></font> Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certain gallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:47</b></font> Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and those poor men, who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemned to death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:48</b></font> Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for the people, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:49</b></font> Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:50</b></font> And so through the covetousness of them that were of power Menelaus remained still in authority, increasing in malice, and being a great traitor to the citizens. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And then it happened, that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn to good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled into the castle: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there to find succour by reason of his kindred: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Now when this that was done came to the king's car, he thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the houses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And there were destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his guide: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave them away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, this man, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put back from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place far the people's sake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with them of the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous than he that set him there; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against his countrymen the Jews. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating of the sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew great multitudes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after the manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, and not to live after the laws of God: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to the people: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things that were not lawful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> The altar also was filled with profane things, which the law forbiddeth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days or ancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And in the day of the king's birth every month they were brought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when the fast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins, so dealeth he with us, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards he should take vengeance of us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: and though he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. And now will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine's flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to live stained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his own accord to the torment, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand out against such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be tasted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the old acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and for the old friendship with them find favour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age, and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of his gray head, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, or rather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answered accordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, being fourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strange religion; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live a little time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to mine old age, and make it abominable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> For though for the present time I should be delivered from the punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, nor dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shew myself such an one as mine age requireth, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> And leave a notable example to such as be young to die willingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And when he had said these words, immediately he went to the torment: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> They that led him changing the good will they bare him a little before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I fear him. </font>
