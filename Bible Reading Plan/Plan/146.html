<font size = "+2"><b>146: Tobit 7:9 - Tobit 13:6</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to the manner, for thou art her cousin, and she is thine, and the merciful God give you good success in all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thy father. And he blessed them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Then they began to eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought her thither: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said unto her, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And she said with him, Amen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Saying, I fear lest he also be dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> But when Raguel was come into his house, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and no man know it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And came forth, and told them that he was alive. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect praise thee for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife be dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Therefore he was very sorry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust; where are do not entreat her evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And when she espied him coming, she said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall away, and he shall see thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall on his fathers' eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which were at Nineve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son, came: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And Tobias' wedding was kept seven days with great joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thou must give him more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Then the old man said, It is due unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> But they that sin are enemies to their own life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And when they arose, they saw him no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath scattered us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you? </font>
