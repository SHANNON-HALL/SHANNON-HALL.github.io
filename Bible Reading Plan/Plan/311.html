<font size = "+2"><b>311: Luke 6:46 - Luke 8:40</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:46</b></font> And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:47</b></font> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:48</b></font> He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:49</b></font> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> But wisdom is justified of all her children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:39</b></font> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:40</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:41</b></font> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:42</b></font> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:43</b></font> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:44</b></font> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:45</b></font> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:46</b></font> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:47</b></font> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:48</b></font> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:49</b></font> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:50</b></font> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:37</b></font> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:38</b></font> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:39</b></font> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:40</b></font> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him. </font>
