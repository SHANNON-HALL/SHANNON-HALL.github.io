<font size = "+2"><b>4: Genesis 13:1 - Genesis 17:22</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

14:3</b></font> All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon- tamar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?
