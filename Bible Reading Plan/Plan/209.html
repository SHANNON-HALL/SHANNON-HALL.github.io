<font size = "+2"><b>209: Wisdom 10:20 - Wisdom 14:20</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly, and praised thy holy name, O Lord, and magnified with one accord thine hand, that fought for them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of them that cannot speak eloquent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> She prospered their works in the hand of the holy prophet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> They went through the wilderness that was not inhabited, and pitched tents in places where there lay no way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> They stood against their enemies, and were avenged of their adversaries. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> When they were thirsty, they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the flinty rock, and their thirst was quenched out of the hard stone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> For by what things their enemies were punished, by the same they in their need were benefited. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> For instead of a perpetual running river troubled with foul blood, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> For a manifest reproof of that commandment, whereby the infants were slain, thou gavest unto them abundance of water by a means which they hoped not for: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> Declaring by that thirst then how thou hadst punished their adversaries. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> For when they were tried albeit but in mercy chastised, they knew how the ungodly were judged in wrath and tormented, thirsting in another manner than the just. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> For these thou didst admonish and try, as a father: but the other, as a severe king, thou didst condemn and punish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> Whether they were absent or present, they were vexed alike. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> For a double grief came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> For when they heard by their own punishments the other to be benefited, they had some feeling of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> For whom they respected with scorn, when he was long before thrown out at the casting forth of the infants, him in the end, when they saw what came to pass, they admired. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> But for the foolish devices of their wickedness, wherewith being deceived they worshipped serpents void of reason, and vile beasts, thou didst send a multitude of unreasonable beasts upon them for vengeance; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> That they might know, that wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> For thy Almighty hand, that made the world of matter without form, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears or fierce lions, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Or unknown wild beasts, full of rage, newly created, breathing out either a fiery vapour, or filthy scents of scattered smoke, or shooting horrible sparkles out of their eyes: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> Whereof not only the harm might dispatch them at once, but also the terrible sight utterly destroy them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with one blast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times when thou wilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of the balance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made: for never wouldest thou have made any thing, if thou hadst hated it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thy will? or been preserved, if not called by thee? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of souls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on thee, O Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathers both those old inhabitants of thy holy land, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts, and wicked sacrifices; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourers of man's flesh, and the feasts of blood, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew, and the parents, that killed with their own hands souls destitute of help: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, might receive a worthy colony of God's children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy them by little and little. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once with cruel beasts, or with one rough word: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; now being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, to be the gods which govern the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first author of beauty hath created them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let them understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> But miserable are they, and in dead things is their hope, who call them gods, which are the works of men's hands, gold and silver, to shew art in, and resemblances of beasts, or a stone good for nothing, the work of an ancient hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Now a carpenter that felleth timber, after he hath sawn down a tree meet for the purpose, and taken off all the bark skilfully round about, and hath wrought it handsomely, and made a vessel thereof fit for the service of man's life; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> And after spending the refuse of his work to dress his meat, hath filled himself; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And taking the very refuse among those which served to no use, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved it diligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formed it by the skill of his understanding, and fashioned it to the image of a man; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Or made it like some vile beast, laying it over with vermilion, and with paint colouring it red, and covering every spot therein; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And when he had made a convenient room for it, set it in a wall, and made it fast with iron: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> For he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing that it was unable to help itself; for it is an image, and hath need of help: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Then maketh he prayer for his goods, for his wife and children, and is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for life prayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth that which hath least means to help: and for a good journey he asketh of that which cannot set a foot forward: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And for gaining and getting, and for good success of his hands, asketh ability to do of him, that is most unable to do any thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured. </font>
