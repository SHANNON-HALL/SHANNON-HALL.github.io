<font size = "+2"><b>160: 1 Maccabees 8:5 - 1 Maccabees 9:64</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came against them in battle, having an hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfited by them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and such as reigned after him should pay a great tribute, and give hostages, and that which was agreed upon, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of the goodliest countries, which they took of him, and gave to king Eumenes: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroy them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them a certain captain, and fighting with them slew many of them, and carried away captives their wives and their children, and spoiled them, and took possession of their lands, and pulled down their strong holds, and brought them to be their servants unto this day: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought under their dominion all other kingdoms and isles that at any time resisted them; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> But with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And that they committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israel with servitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they spake and said. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> So that matter pleased the Romans well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be far from them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their dominion, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without taking any thing therefore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> Neither shall victuals be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that without deceit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> According to these articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to gather them together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> They also of Judas' side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardy men, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> But when they of the left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> In those days also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and went with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords of the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> And they made enquiry and search for Judas' friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used them despitefully. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> For this cause all Judas' friends came together, and said unto Jonathan, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his brother Judas. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:33</b></font> Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:34</b></font> Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:35</b></font> Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:36</b></font> But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:37</b></font> After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:38</b></font> Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:39</b></font> Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:40</b></font> Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:41</b></font> Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:42</b></font> So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh of Jordan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:43</b></font> Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a great power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:44</b></font> Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:45</b></font> For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:46</b></font> Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:47</b></font> With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:48</b></font> Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:49</b></font> So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about a thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:50</b></font> Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:51</b></font> And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:52</b></font> He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:53</b></font> Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:54</b></font> Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of the prophets <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:55</b></font> And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:56</b></font> So Alcimus died at that time with great torment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:57</b></font> Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:58</b></font> Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:59</b></font> So they went and consulted with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:60</b></font> Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:61</b></font> Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:62</b></font> Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:63</b></font> Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:64</b></font> Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made engines of war. </font>
