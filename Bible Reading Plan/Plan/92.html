<font size = "+2"><b>92: 2 Samuel 3:17 - 2 Samuel 6:19</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And, Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:37</b></font> For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:38</b></font> And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:39</b></font> And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed- edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. </font>
