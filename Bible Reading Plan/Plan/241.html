Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go.
