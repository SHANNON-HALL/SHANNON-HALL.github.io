<font size = "+2"><b>100: 1 Kings 1:28 - 1 Kings 3:4</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:43</b></font> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:44</b></font> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:45</b></font> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:46</b></font> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:47</b></font> And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:48</b></font> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:49</b></font> And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:50</b></font> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:51</b></font> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:52</b></font> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:53</b></font> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:37</b></font> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:38</b></font> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:39</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:40</b></font> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:41</b></font> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:42</b></font> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:43</b></font> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:44</b></font> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:45</b></font> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:46</b></font> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. </font>
