36:2</b></font> And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.

twenty boards for the south side southward: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:24</b></font> And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:25</b></font> And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:26</b></font> And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:27</b></font> And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:28</b></font> And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:29</b></font> And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:30</b></font> And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:31</b></font> And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:32</b></font> And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:33</b></font> And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:34</b></font> And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:35</b></font> And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:36</b></font> And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:37</b></font> And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:38</b></font> And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

37:2</b></font> And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
