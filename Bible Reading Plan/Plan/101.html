And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> So king Solomon was king over all Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> So Solomon built the house, and finished it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. </font>
