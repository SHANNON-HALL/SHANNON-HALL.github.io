I am thy brother, be of good cheer: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Thou shalt not die, though our our commandment be general: come near. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And so be held up his golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And embraced her, and said, Speak unto me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy countenance is full of grace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> The great king Artexerxes unto the princes and governors of an hundred and seven and twenty provinces from India unto Ethiopia, and unto all our faithful subjects, greeting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> Many, the more often they are honoured with the great bounty of their gracious princes, the more proud they are waxen, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And endeavour to hurt not our subjects only, but not being able to bear abundance, do take in hand to practise also against those that do them good: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And take not only thankfulness away from among men, but also lifted up with the glorious words of lewd persons, that were never good, they think to escape the justice of God, that seeth all things and hateth evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> Oftentimes also fair speech of those, that are put in trust to manage their friends' affairs, hath caused many that are in authority to be partakers of innocent blood, and hath enwrapped them in remediless calamities: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> Beguiling with the falsehood and deceit of their lewd disposition the innocency and goodness of princes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> Now ye may see this, as we have declared, not so much by ancient histories, as ye may, if ye search what hath been wickedly done of late through the pestilent behaviour of them that are unworthily placed in authority. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> And we must take care for the time to come, that our kingdom may be quiet and peaceable for all men, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Both by changing our purposes, and always judging things that are evident with more equal proceeding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> For Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadatha, being indeed a stranger from the Persian blood, and far distant from our goodness, and as a stranger received of us, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> Had so far forth obtained the favour that we shew toward every nation, as that he was called our father, and was continually honoured of all the next person unto the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> But he, not bearing his great dignity, went about to deprive us of our kingdom and life: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Having by manifold and cunning deceits sought of us the destruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, and continually procured our good, as also of blameless Esther, partaker of our kingdom, with their whole nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> For by these means he thought, finding us destitute of friends to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> But we find that the Jews, whom this wicked wretch hath delivered to utter destruction, are no evildoers, but live by most just laws: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And that they be children of the most high and most mighty, living God, who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to our progenitors in the most excellent manner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> Wherefore ye shall do well not to put in execution the letters sent unto you by Aman the son of Amadatha. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> For he that was the worker of these things, is hanged at the gates of Susa with all his family: God, who ruleth all things, speedily rendering vengeance to him according to his deserts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> Therefore ye shall publish the copy of this letter in all places, that the Jews may freely live after their own laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And ye shall aid them, that even the same day, being the thirteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, they may be avenged on them, who in the time of their affliction shall set upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> For Almighty God hath turned to joy unto them the day, wherein the chosen people should have perished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Ye shall therefore among your solemn feasts keep it an high day with all feasting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> That both now and hereafter there may be safety to us and the well affected Persians; but to those which do conspire against us a memorial of destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Therefore every city and country whatsoever, which shall not do according to these things, shall be destroyed without mercy with fire and sword, and shall be made not only unpassable for men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and fowls for ever. <p><p><p><b>The First Book of the Maccabees</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over Greece, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And his servants bare rule every one in his place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; so did their sons after them many years: and evils were multiplied in the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with the heathen that are round about us: for since we departed from them we have had much sorrow. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> So this device pleased them well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the heathen: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, and the vials. and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown, and the golden ornaments that were before the temple, all which he pulled off. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> He took also the silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> So that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> The land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> But the women and children took they captive, and possessed the cattle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and so they became a sore snare: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased, and her excellency was turned into mourning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:43</b></font> Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:44</b></font> For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of the land, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:45</b></font> And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and festival days: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:46</b></font> And pollute the sanctuary and holy people: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:47</b></font> Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:48</b></font> That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:49</b></font> To the end they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:50</b></font> And whosoever would not do according to the commandment of the king, he said, he should die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:51</b></font> In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:52</b></font> Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:53</b></font> And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever they could flee for succour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:54</b></font> Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;
