And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.

And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. </font>
