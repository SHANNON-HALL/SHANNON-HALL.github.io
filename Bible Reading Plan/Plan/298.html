<font size = "+2"><b>298: Matthew 15:10 - Matthew 18:20</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:36</b></font> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:37</b></font> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:38</b></font> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:39</b></font> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. </font>
