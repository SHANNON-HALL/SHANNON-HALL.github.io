Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 66:4</b></font> I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 66:5</b></font> Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 66:6</b></font> A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 66:7</b></font> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 66:8</b></font> Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things?
