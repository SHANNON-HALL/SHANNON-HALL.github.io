<font size = "+2"><b>339: Romans 11:13 - Romans 15:29</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Let not then your good be evil spoken of: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. </font>
