69:7</b></font> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:8</b></font> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:9</b></font> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:10</b></font> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and for comforters, but I found none. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:21</b></font> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:22</b></font> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:23</b></font> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:24</b></font> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:25</b></font> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:26</b></font> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:27</b></font> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:28</b></font> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:29</b></font> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:30</b></font> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:31</b></font> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:32</b></font> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:33</b></font> For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:34</b></font> Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:35</b></font> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 69:36</b></font> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein. <p>Psalm 70 <p>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

for thou art my rock and my fortress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:4</b></font> Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:5</b></font> For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:6</b></font> By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

71:9</b></font> Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:10</b></font> For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:11</b></font> Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:12</b></font> O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:13</b></font> Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:14</b></font> But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:15</b></font> My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:16</b></font> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:17</b></font> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:18</b></font> Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:19</b></font> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:20</b></font> Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:21</b></font> Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 71:24</b></font> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt. </font>
