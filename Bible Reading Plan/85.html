<font size = "+2"><b>85: 1 Samuel 14:33 - 1 Samuel 17:3</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:36</b></font> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:37</b></font> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:38</b></font> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:39</b></font> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:40</b></font> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:41</b></font> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:42</b></font> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:43</b></font> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:44</b></font> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:45</b></font> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:46</b></font> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:47</b></font> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:48</b></font> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:49</b></font> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:50</b></font> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:51</b></font> And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:52</b></font> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them. </font>
