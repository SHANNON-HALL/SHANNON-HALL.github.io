<font size = "+2"><b>61: Deuteronomy 24:5 - Deuteronomy 27:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

24:22</b></font> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

25:8</b></font> Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:5</b></font> And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:6</b></font> Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:8</b></font> And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:9</b></font> And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:10</b></font> Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:11</b></font> And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
