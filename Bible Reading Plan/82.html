<font size = "+2"><b>82: 1 Samuel 4:19 - 1 Samuel 8:22</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth- shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.
