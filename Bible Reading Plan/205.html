<font size = "+2"><b>205: Ecclesiastes 8:16 - Song of Songs 2:15</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <p><p><p><b>The Song of Solomon</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The song of songs, which is Solomon's. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. </font>
