<font size = "+2"><b>110: 2 Kings 2:9 - 2 Kings 4:37</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they bring it to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out. </font>
