And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore;

22:23</b></font> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. </font>
