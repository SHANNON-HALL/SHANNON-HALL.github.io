<font size = "+2"><b>109: 1 Kings 22:1 - 2 Kings 2:8</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:3</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth- gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth- gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:25</b></font> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:27</b></font> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:28</b></font> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:29</b></font> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:30</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:31</b></font> But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:32</b></font> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:33</b></font> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:34</b></font> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:35</b></font> And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:36</b></font> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:37</b></font> So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:38</b></font> And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:39</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:40</b></font> So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:41</b></font> And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:42</b></font> Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:43</b></font> And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:44</b></font> And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:45</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:46</b></font> And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:47</b></font> There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:48</b></font> Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:49</b></font> Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:50</b></font> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:51</b></font> Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:52</b></font> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:53</b></font> For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done. <p><p><p><b>The Second Book of the Kings Commonly Called the Fourth Book of the Kings</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. </font>
