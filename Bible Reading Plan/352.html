1:2</b></font> To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. </font>
