it hath been already of old time, which was before us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. </font>
