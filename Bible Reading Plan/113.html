And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'. </font>
