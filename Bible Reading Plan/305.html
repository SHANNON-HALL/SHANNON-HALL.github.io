<font size = "+2"><b>305: Mark 7:1 - Mark 9:37</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
