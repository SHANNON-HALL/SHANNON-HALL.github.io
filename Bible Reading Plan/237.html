<font size = "+2"><b>237: Isaiah 59:9 - Isaiah 64:8</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:9</b></font> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:10</b></font> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:11</b></font> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:12</b></font> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:13</b></font> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:14</b></font> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:15</b></font> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:16</b></font> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:17</b></font> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:18</b></font> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:19</b></font> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:20</b></font> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 59:21</b></font> As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:1</b></font> Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:2</b></font> For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:3</b></font> And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:4</b></font> Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:5</b></font> Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:6</b></font> The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:7</b></font> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:8</b></font> Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:9</b></font> Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:10</b></font> And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:11</b></font> Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:12</b></font> For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:13</b></font> The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:14</b></font> The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:15</b></font> Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:16</b></font> Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:17</b></font> For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:18</b></font> Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:19</b></font> The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:20</b></font> Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 60:21</b></font> Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:2</b></font> To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:3</b></font> To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:4</b></font> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:5</b></font> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:6</b></font> But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:7</b></font> For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:8</b></font> For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:9</b></font> And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:10</b></font> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 61:11</b></font> For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:1</b></font> For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:2</b></font> And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:3</b></font> Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

62:7</b></font> And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:8</b></font> The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:9</b></font> But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:10</b></font> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highways; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:11</b></font> Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 62:12</b></font> And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:1</b></font> Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:2</b></font> Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:3</b></font> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:4</b></font> For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:5</b></font> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:6</b></font> And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:7</b></font> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:8</b></font> For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:9</b></font> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:10</b></font> But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:11</b></font> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:12</b></font> That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:13</b></font> That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:14</b></font> As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:15</b></font> Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:16</b></font> Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:17</b></font> O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:18</b></font> The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 63:19</b></font> We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:1</b></font> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:2</b></font> As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:3</b></font> When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:4</b></font> For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:5</b></font> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:6</b></font> But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:7</b></font> And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 64:8</b></font> But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. </font>
