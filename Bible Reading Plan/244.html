Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:3</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them. </font>
