And he answered, No. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:43</b></font> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:44</b></font> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:45</b></font> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:46</b></font> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:47</b></font> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:48</b></font> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:49</b></font> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:50</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:51</b></font> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> But he spake of the temple of his body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> For John was not yet cast into prison. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> He must increase, but I must decrease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. </font>
