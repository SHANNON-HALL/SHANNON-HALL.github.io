<font size = "+2"><b>78: Judges 17:7 - Judges 20:7</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> And they cried unto the children of Dan.
