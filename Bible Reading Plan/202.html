<font size = "+2"><b>202: Proverbs 25:1 - Proverbs 29:27</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:18</b></font> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:19</b></font> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:20</b></font> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:21</b></font> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:22</b></font> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:23</b></font> The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:24</b></font> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:25</b></font> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:26</b></font> A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:27</b></font> It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:28</b></font> He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:22</b></font> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:23</b></font> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:24</b></font> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:25</b></font> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:26</b></font> Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:27</b></font> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:28</b></font> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:5</b></font> Open rebuke is better than secret love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:6</b></font> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:8</b></font> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:9</b></font> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:10</b></font> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:11</b></font> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:12</b></font> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:13</b></font> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:14</b></font> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:15</b></font> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:16</b></font> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:17</b></font> Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:18</b></font> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:19</b></font> As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:20</b></font> Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:21</b></font> As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:22</b></font> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:23</b></font> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:24</b></font> For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:25</b></font> The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:26</b></font> The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:27</b></font> And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:1</b></font> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:2</b></font> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:3</b></font> A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:4</b></font> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:5</b></font> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:6</b></font> Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:7</b></font> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:8</b></font> He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:9</b></font> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:10</b></font> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:11</b></font> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:12</b></font> When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:13</b></font> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:14</b></font> Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:15</b></font> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:16</b></font> The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:17</b></font> A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:18</b></font> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:19</b></font> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:20</b></font> A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:21</b></font> To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:22</b></font> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:23</b></font> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:24</b></font> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:25</b></font> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:26</b></font> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:27</b></font> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:28</b></font> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:1</b></font> He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:2</b></font> When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:3</b></font> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:4</b></font> The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:5</b></font> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:14</b></font> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:15</b></font> The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:16</b></font> When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:17</b></font> Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:21</b></font> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:22</b></font> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:23</b></font> A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:24</b></font> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:25</b></font> The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:26</b></font> Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:27</b></font> An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. </font>
