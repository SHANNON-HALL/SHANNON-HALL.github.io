<font size = "+2"><b>74: Judges 6:28 - Judges 8:35</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:38</b></font> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:39</b></font> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:40</b></font> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel- meholah, unto Tabbath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel. </font>
