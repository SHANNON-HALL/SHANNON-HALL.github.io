<font size = "+2"><b>95: 2 Samuel 13:19 - 2 Samuel 15:23</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal- hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous and be valiant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:38</b></font> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:39</b></font> And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. </font>
