<font size = "+2"><b>204: Ecclesiastes 3:16 - Ecclesiastes 8:15</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. </font>
