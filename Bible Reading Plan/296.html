A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And charged them that they should not make him known: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:37</b></font> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:38</b></font> Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:39</b></font> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:40</b></font> For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:41</b></font> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:42</b></font> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:43</b></font> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:44</b></font> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:45</b></font> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. </font>
