And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
