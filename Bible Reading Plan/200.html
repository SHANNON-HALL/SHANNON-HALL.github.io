<font size = "+2"><b>200: Proverbs 15:1 - Proverbs 19:29</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> A just weight and balance are the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag are his work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:32</b></font> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:33</b></font> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:28</b></font> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. </font>
