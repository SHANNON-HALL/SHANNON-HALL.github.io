To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.

<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

1:13</b></font> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> (Touch not; taste not; handle not; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh. </font>
