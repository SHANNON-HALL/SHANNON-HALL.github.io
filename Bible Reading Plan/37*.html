20:23</b></font> And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

21:7</b></font> They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

21:22</b></font> He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:23</b></font> Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:24</b></font> And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

22:11</b></font> But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
