he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:39</b></font> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:40</b></font> And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:41</b></font> He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:42</b></font> He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:43</b></font> But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:44</b></font> But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:45</b></font> And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. <p><p><p><b>The Prayer of Azariah</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
