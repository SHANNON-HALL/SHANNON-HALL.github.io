<font size = "+2"><b>249: Jeremiah 33:1 - Jeremiah 36:10</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:1</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:12</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:13</b></font> In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:21</b></font> Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:22</b></font> As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:23</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:24</b></font> Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:25</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:26</b></font> Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:1</b></font> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:13</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:14</b></font> At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:15</b></font> And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:16</b></font> But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:17</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:18</b></font> And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:19</b></font> The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:20</b></font> I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:21</b></font> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:22</b></font> Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:1</b></font> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:2</b></font> Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:3</b></font> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:4</b></font> And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:5</b></font> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:6</b></font> But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:7</b></font> Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:8</b></font> Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:9</b></font> Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:10</b></font> But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:11</b></font> But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:12</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:13</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:14</b></font> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:15</b></font> I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:16</b></font> Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:17</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:18</b></font> And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 35:19</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:2</b></font> Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even into this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:7</b></font> It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:8</b></font> And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:9</b></font> And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:10</b></font> Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people. </font>
