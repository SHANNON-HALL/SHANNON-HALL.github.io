<font size = "+2"><b>198: Proverbs 4:14 - Proverbs 9:12</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. </font>
