I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into it again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also over the things therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> He endued them with strength by themselves, and made them according to his image, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding, and shewed them good and evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> He set his eye upon their hearts, that he might shew them the greatness of his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> He gave them to glory in his marvellous acts for ever, that they might declare his works with understanding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And the elect shall praise his holy name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> Beside this he gave them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> He made an everlasting covenant with them, and shewed them his judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And he said unto them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and he gave every man commandment concerning his neighbour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> Their ways are ever before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> Every man from his youth is given to evil; neither could they make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> For in the division of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but Israel is the Lord's portion: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> Whom, being his firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline, and giving him the light of his love doth not forsake him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> Therefore all their works are as the sun before him, and his eyes are continually upon their ways. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sins are before the Lord <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> But the Lord being gracious and knowing his workmanship, neither left nor forsook them, but spared them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> Afterwards he will rise up and reward them, and render their recompence upon their heads. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> But unto them that repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in patience. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> Return unto the Lord, and forsake thy sins, make thy prayer before his face, and offend less. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity: for he will lead thee out of darkness into the light of health, and hate thou abomination vehemently. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:28</b></font> Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not: the living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:29</b></font> How great is the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and his compassion unto such as turn unto him in holiness! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:30</b></font> For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:31</b></font> What is brighter than the sun? yet the light thereof faileth; and flesh and blood will imagine evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:32</b></font> He vieweth the power of the height of heaven; and all men are but earth and ashes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> He that liveth for ever Hath created all things in general. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> The Lord only is righteous, and there is none other but he, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> Who governeth the world with the palm of his hand, and all things obey his will: for he is the King of all, by his power dividing holy things among them from profane. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> To whom hath he given power to declare his works? and who shall find out his noble acts? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> Who shall number the strength of his majesty? and who shall also tell out his mercies? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> When a man hath done, then he beginneth; and when he leaveth off, then he shall be doubtful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> What is man, and whereto serveth he? what is his good, and what is his evil? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> The number of a man's days at the most are an hundred years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> As a drop of water unto the sea, and a gravelstone in comparison of the sand; so are a thousand years to the days of eternity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> Therefore is God patient with them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> He saw and perceived their end to be evil; therefore he multiplied his compassion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> The mercy of man is toward his neighbour; but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh: he reproveth, and nurtureth, and teacheth and bringeth again, as a shepherd his flock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> He hath mercy on them that receive discipline, and that diligently seek after his judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither use uncomfortable words when thou givest any thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> Shall not the dew asswage the heat? so is a word better than a gift. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> A fool will upbraid churlishly, and a gift of the envious consumeth the eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Learn before thou speak, and use physick or ever thou be sick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Before judgment examine thyself, and in the day of visitation thou shalt find mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Humble thyself before thou be sick, and in the time of sins shew repentance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Before thou prayest, prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> Think upon the wrath that shall be at the end, and the time of vengeance, when he shall turn away his face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> When thou hast enough, remember the time of hunger: and when thou art rich, think upon poverty and need. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> From the morning until the evening the time is changed, and all things are soon done before the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the day of sinning he will beware of offence: but a fool will not observe time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give praise unto him that found her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> They that were of understanding in sayings became also wise themselves, and poured forth exquisite parables. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> If thou givest thy soul the desires that please her, she will make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies that malign thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> Take not pleasure in much good cheer, neither be tied to the expence thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing, when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt lie in wait for thine own life, and be talked on. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that hateth babbling shall have less evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a word within a fool's belly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, and believe not every tale. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted of him, and wisdom obtaineth his love. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the performance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there is a fool wanting in wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will do evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> A man may be known by his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate. </font>
