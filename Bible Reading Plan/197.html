to perceive the words of understanding; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
