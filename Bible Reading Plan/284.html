let them come up: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion. <p><p><p><b>Amos</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Can two walk together, except they be agreed? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? </font>
