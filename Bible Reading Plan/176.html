<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> Is there any number of his armies?
