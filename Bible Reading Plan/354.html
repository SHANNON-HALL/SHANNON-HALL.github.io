<font size = "+2"><b>354: Hebrews 3:1 - Hebrews 8:13</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And this will we do, if God permit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. </font>
