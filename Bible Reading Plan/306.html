But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:37</b></font> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:38</b></font> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:39</b></font> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:40</b></font> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:41</b></font> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:42</b></font> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:43</b></font> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:44</b></font> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:45</b></font> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:46</b></font> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:47</b></font> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:48</b></font> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:49</b></font> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:50</b></font> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:51</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:52</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And when even was come, he went out of the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way. </font>
