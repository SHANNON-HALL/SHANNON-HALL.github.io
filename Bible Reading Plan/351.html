Amen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> For Adam was first formed, then Eve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. </font>
