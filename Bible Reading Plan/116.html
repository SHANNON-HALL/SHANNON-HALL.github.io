His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And Rab- shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:33</b></font> Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:34</b></font> Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:35</b></font> Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:36</b></font> But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:37</b></font> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:23</b></font> By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:24</b></font> I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:25</b></font> Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:26</b></font> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:27</b></font> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:28</b></font> Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:29</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:30</b></font> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:31</b></font> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:32</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:33</b></font> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:34</b></font> For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:35</b></font> And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:36</b></font> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:37</b></font> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
