<font size = "+2"><b>168: 2 Maccabees 6:31 - 2 Maccabees 8:35</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men, but unto all his nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their mother were taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine's flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> So when the first was dead after this number, they brought the second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thou be punished throughout every member of thy body? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in order, as the former did. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth his hands manfully. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man's courage, for that he nothing regarded the pains. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt escape unpunished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws' sake. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend, and trust him with affairs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the young man to save his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king's commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers by Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> For we suffer because of our sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> And though the living Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up thy hand against the servants of God: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God's covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:39</b></font> Than the king' being in a rage, handed him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that he was mocked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:40</b></font> So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:41</b></font> Last of all after the sons the mother died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:42</b></font> Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and took unto them all such as continued in the Jews' religion, and assembled about six thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon the people that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew his hatred against the wicked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of his enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> But specially took he advantage of the night for such privy attempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread every where. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> So when Philip saw that this man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with him still more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king's affairs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of war had great experience. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that they should have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor's coming, and he had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they met together: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name's sake, by which they were called. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of six thousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wrongly against them; but to fight manfully, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And to set before their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of their forefathers: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and also all the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand perished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a great booty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and ready to die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of each band, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading the first band, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor's host, and so put all to flight; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they returned: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiled their enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> When this was done, and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> And when they had gathered their armour together, they laid them up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host was destroyed. </font>
