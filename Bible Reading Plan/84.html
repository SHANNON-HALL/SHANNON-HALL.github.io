<font size = "+2"><b>84: 1 Samuel 12:1 - 1 Samuel 14:32</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth- aven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. </font>
