<font size = "+2"><b>50: Numbers 26:63 - Numbers 29:40</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:63</b></font> These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:64</b></font> But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:65</b></font> For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:1</b></font> Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:2</b></font> And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:3</b></font> Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:4</b></font> Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:5</b></font> And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:6</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:7</b></font> The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:8</b></font> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:9</b></font> And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:10</b></font> And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:11</b></font> And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:12</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:13</b></font> And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

27:15</b></font> And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:16</b></font> Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:17</b></font> Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:18</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:19</b></font> And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:20</b></font> And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
