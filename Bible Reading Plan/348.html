<font size = "+2"><b>348: Ephesians 4:17 - Philippians 2:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> But ye have not so learned Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Neither give place to the devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Be not ye therefore partakers with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. <p><p><p><b>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> What then?
