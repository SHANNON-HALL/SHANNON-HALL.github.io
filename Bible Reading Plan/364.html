And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:22</b></font> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:23</b></font> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:24</b></font> And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:25</b></font> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:26</b></font> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:27</b></font> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life. </font>
