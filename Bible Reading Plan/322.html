<font size = "+2"><b>322: John 8:12 - John 10:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> As he spake these words, many believed on him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:37</b></font> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:38</b></font> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:39</b></font> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:40</b></font> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:41</b></font> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:42</b></font> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:43</b></font> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:44</b></font> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:45</b></font> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:46</b></font> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:47</b></font> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:48</b></font> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:49</b></font> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:50</b></font> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:51</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:52</b></font> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:53</b></font> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:54</b></font> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:55</b></font> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:56</b></font> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:57</b></font> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:58</b></font> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:59</b></font> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:33</b></font> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:34</b></font> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:35</b></font> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:36</b></font> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:37</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:38</b></font> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:39</b></font> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:40</b></font> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:41</b></font> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
