<font size = "+2"><b>294: Matthew 3:13 - Matthew 6:34</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:40</b></font> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:41</b></font> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:42</b></font> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:43</b></font> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:44</b></font> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:45</b></font> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:46</b></font> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:47</b></font> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:48</b></font> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Give us this day our daily bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. </font>
