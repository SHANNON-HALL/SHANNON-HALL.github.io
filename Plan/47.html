<font size = "+2"><b>47: Numbers 18:20 - Numbers 21:20</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:26</b></font> Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:27</b></font> And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:28</b></font> Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:29</b></font> Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:30</b></font> Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:31</b></font> And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:32</b></font> And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

19:8</b></font> And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

19:13</b></font> Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:1</b></font> Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:2</b></font> And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:3</b></font> And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:4</b></font> And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:5</b></font> And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:6</b></font> And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:7</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:8</b></font> Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:9</b></font> And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:10</b></font> And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:11</b></font> And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:27</b></font> And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:28</b></font> And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:29</b></font> And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. </font>
