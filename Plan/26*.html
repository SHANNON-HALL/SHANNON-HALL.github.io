and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:40</b></font> And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:3</b></font> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:4</b></font> And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:5</b></font> And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:11</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:12</b></font> When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:13</b></font> This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:14</b></font> Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:15</b></font> The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:17</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:18</b></font> Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:19</b></font> For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:20</b></font> When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:21</b></font> So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:24</b></font> And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:25</b></font> And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:26</b></font> And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:27</b></font> And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:28</b></font> And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:29</b></font> And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:30</b></font> And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:31</b></font> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:32</b></font> Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:33</b></font> Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

30:35</b></font> And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:36</b></font> And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:37</b></font> And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:38</b></font> Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:2</b></font> See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:3</b></font> And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:4</b></font> To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:14</b></font> Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:15</b></font> Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:16</b></font> Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:17</b></font> It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:18</b></font> And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:6</b></font> And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:7</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:8</b></font> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:9</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:10</b></font> Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:11</b></font> And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:12</b></font> Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:13</b></font> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:14</b></font> And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. </font>
