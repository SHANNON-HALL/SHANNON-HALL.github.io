If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:15</b></font> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:16</b></font> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:17</b></font> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:18</b></font> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:19</b></font> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:20</b></font> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:21</b></font> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:22</b></font> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:23</b></font> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:24</b></font> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:25</b></font> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:26</b></font> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:27</b></font> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:28</b></font> And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:29</b></font> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:30</b></font> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:31</b></font> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:32</b></font> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:33</b></font> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:34</b></font> And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:1</b></font> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:2</b></font> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:3</b></font> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:4</b></font> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:5</b></font> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:6</b></font> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:7</b></font> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:8</b></font> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:9</b></font> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:10</b></font> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:11</b></font> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:12</b></font> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:13</b></font> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:14</b></font> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:15</b></font> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:16</b></font> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:17</b></font> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:18</b></font> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:19</b></font> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:20</b></font> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:21</b></font> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:22</b></font> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:23</b></font> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:24</b></font> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:25</b></font> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:26</b></font> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:27</b></font> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:28</b></font> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:29</b></font> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:30</b></font> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:31</b></font> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:32</b></font> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:33</b></font> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 44:34</b></font> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:1</b></font> Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:2</b></font> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:3</b></font> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:4</b></font> And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:5</b></font> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:6</b></font> For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:7</b></font> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:8</b></font> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:9</b></font> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:10</b></font> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:11</b></font> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:12</b></font> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:13</b></font> And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:14</b></font> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:15</b></font> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:16</b></font> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:17</b></font> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:18</b></font> And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:19</b></font> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:20</b></font> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:21</b></font> And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:22</b></font> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:23</b></font> And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:24</b></font> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. </font>
