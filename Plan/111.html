<font size = "+2"><b>111: 2 Kings 4:38 - 2 Kings ]7:11</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within. </font>
