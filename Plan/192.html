105:2</b></font> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:3</b></font> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:4</b></font> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:5</b></font> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:6</b></font> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:7</b></font> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:8</b></font> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:9</b></font> Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:10</b></font> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:11</b></font> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:12</b></font> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:13</b></font> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:14</b></font> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:15</b></font> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:16</b></font> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:17</b></font> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:18</b></font> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:19</b></font> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:20</b></font> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:21</b></font> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:22</b></font> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:23</b></font> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:24</b></font> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:25</b></font> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:26</b></font> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:27</b></font> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:28</b></font> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:29</b></font> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:30</b></font> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:31</b></font> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:32</b></font> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:33</b></font> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:34</b></font> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:35</b></font> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:36</b></font> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:37</b></font> He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:38</b></font> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:39</b></font> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:40</b></font> The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:41</b></font> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:42</b></font> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:43</b></font> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:44</b></font> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 105:45</b></font> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. <p>Psalm 106 <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:1</b></font> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:2</b></font> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:3</b></font> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:4</b></font> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:5</b></font> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:6</b></font> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:7</b></font> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:8</b></font> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:9</b></font> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:10</b></font> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:11</b></font> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:12</b></font> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:13</b></font> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:14</b></font> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:15</b></font> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:16</b></font> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:17</b></font> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:18</b></font> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:19</b></font> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:20</b></font> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:21</b></font> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:22</b></font> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:23</b></font> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:24</b></font> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:25</b></font> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:26</b></font> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:27</b></font> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:28</b></font> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:29</b></font> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:30</b></font> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:31</b></font> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:32</b></font> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:33</b></font> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:34</b></font> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:35</b></font> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:36</b></font> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:37</b></font> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:38</b></font> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:39</b></font> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:40</b></font> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:41</b></font> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:42</b></font> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:43</b></font> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:44</b></font> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:45</b></font> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:46</b></font> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:47</b></font> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 106:48</b></font> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. <p>Book V <p>Psalm 107 <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:1</b></font> O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:2</b></font> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:3</b></font> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:4</b></font> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:5</b></font> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:6</b></font> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:7</b></font> And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:8</b></font> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:9</b></font> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:10</b></font> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:11</b></font> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:12</b></font> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:13</b></font> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:14</b></font> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:15</b></font> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:16</b></font> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:17</b></font> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:18</b></font> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:19</b></font> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:20</b></font> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:21</b></font> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:22</b></font> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:23</b></font> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:24</b></font> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:25</b></font> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:26</b></font> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:27</b></font> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:28</b></font> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:29</b></font> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:30</b></font> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:31</b></font> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:32</b></font> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:33</b></font> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:34</b></font> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:35</b></font> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:36</b></font> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:37</b></font> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:38</b></font> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:39</b></font> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:40</b></font> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:41</b></font> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:42</b></font> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 107:43</b></font> Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. <p>Psalm 108 <p>A Song or Psalm of David. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:1</b></font> O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:2</b></font> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:3</b></font> I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:4</b></font> For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:5</b></font> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:6</b></font> That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:7</b></font> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:8</b></font> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:9</b></font> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:10</b></font> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:11</b></font> Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:12</b></font> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 108:13</b></font> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. </font>
