<font size = "+2"><b>80: Ruth 1:19 - 1 Samuel 1:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. <p><p><p><b>The First Book of Samuel Otherwise Called the First Book of the Kings</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. </font>
