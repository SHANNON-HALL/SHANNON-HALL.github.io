<font size = "+2"><b>226: Isaiah 10:1 - Isaiah 14:23</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

10:28</b></font> He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

12:4</b></font> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and they shall rule over their oppressors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

14:13</b></font> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. </font>
