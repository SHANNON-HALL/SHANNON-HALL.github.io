And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:32</b></font> And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:33</b></font> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:34</b></font> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:35</b></font> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:36</b></font> And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-gaber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:37</b></font> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:3</b></font> He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. </font>
