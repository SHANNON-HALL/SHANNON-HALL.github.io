<font size = "+2"><b>263: Ezekiel 16:35 - Ezekiel 18:24</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:35</b></font> Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:36</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:37</b></font> Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:38</b></font> And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:39</b></font> And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:40</b></font> They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:41</b></font> And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:42</b></font> So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:43</b></font> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:44</b></font> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:45</b></font> Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:46</b></font> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:47</b></font> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:48</b></font> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:49</b></font> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:50</b></font> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:51</b></font> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:52</b></font> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:53</b></font> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:54</b></font> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:55</b></font> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:56</b></font> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:57</b></font> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:58</b></font> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:59</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:60</b></font> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:61</b></font> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:62</b></font> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:63</b></font> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. </font>
