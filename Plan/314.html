<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?

And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And they could not answer him again to these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. </font>
