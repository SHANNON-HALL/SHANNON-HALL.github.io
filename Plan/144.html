<font size = "+2"><b>144: Nehemiah 13:1 - Tobit 3:9</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. <p><p><p><b>The Book of Tobit</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father's mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> But I kept myself from eating; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Because I remembered God with all my heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents of silver. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go into Media. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael's son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him: and he was my brother's son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restored unto me, with my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, in the which I sat down to eat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And when I saw abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go and bring what poor man soever thou shalt find out of our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord; and, lo, I tarry for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> But he came again, and said, Father, one of our nation is strangled, and is cast out in the marketplace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Then before I had tasted of any meat, I started up, and took him up into a room until the going down of the sun. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat in heaviness, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Remembering that prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Therefore I wept: and after the going down of the sun I went and made a grave, and buried him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> But my neighbours mocked me, and said, This man is not yet afraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; and yet, lo, he burieth the dead again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> The same night also I returned from the burial, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted and my face was uncovered: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went into Elymais. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And my wife Anna did take women's works to do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said unto her, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more than the wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render it to the owners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied upon me, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, thou and all thy works are known. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> O Lord, thou art just, and all thy works and all thy ways are mercy and truth, and thou judgest truly and justly for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins and ignorances, and the sins of my fathers, who have sinned before thee: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> For they obeyed not thy commandments: wherefore thou hast delivered us for a spoil, and unto captivity, and unto death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers': because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father's maids; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter. </font>
