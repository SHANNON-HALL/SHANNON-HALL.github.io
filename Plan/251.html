<font size = "+2"><b>251: Jeremiah 39:4 - Jeremiah 42:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:4</b></font> And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:5</b></font> But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:6</b></font> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:7</b></font> Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:8</b></font> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:9</b></font> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:10</b></font> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:11</b></font> Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:12</b></font> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:13</b></font> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:14</b></font> Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:15</b></font> Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:16</b></font> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:17</b></font> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 39:18</b></font> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:2</b></font> And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:3</b></font> Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:4</b></font> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:5</b></font> Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:6</b></font> Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:7</b></font> Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:8</b></font> Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:9</b></font> And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:10</b></font> As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:11</b></font> Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:12</b></font> Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:13</b></font> Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:14</b></font> And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:15</b></font> Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:16</b></font> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:1</b></font> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:2</b></font> Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:3</b></font> Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:4</b></font> And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:5</b></font> That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:6</b></font> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:7</b></font> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:8</b></font> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:9</b></font> Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:10</b></font> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:11</b></font> But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:12</b></font> Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:13</b></font> Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:14</b></font> So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:15</b></font> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:16</b></font> Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:17</b></font> And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:18</b></font> Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:1</b></font> Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:2</b></font> And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:3</b></font> That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:4</b></font> Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:5</b></font> Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:6</b></font> Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:7</b></font> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:8</b></font> Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:9</b></font> And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:10</b></font> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:11</b></font> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:12</b></font> And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:13</b></font> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:14</b></font> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:15</b></font> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:16</b></font> Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:17</b></font> So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:18</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. </font>
