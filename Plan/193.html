<font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:2</b></font> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:3</b></font> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:4</b></font> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:5</b></font> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:6</b></font> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:7</b></font> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:8</b></font> Let his days be few; and let another take his office. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:15</b></font> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:16</b></font> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:17</b></font> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:18</b></font> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:19</b></font> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

109:22</b></font> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:23</b></font> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:24</b></font> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:25</b></font> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:26</b></font> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:27</b></font> That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:28</b></font> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 109:29</b></font> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
