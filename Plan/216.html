<font size = "+2"><b>216: Sirach 20:12 - Sirach 23:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:12</b></font> There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:13</b></font> A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:14</b></font> The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:15</b></font> He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:16</b></font> The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:17</b></font> How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:18</b></font> To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:19</b></font> An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:20</b></font> A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:21</b></font> There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:22</b></font> There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:23</b></font> There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:24</b></font> A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:25</b></font> A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:26</b></font> The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:27</b></font> A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:28</b></font> He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:29</b></font> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:30</b></font> Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:31</b></font> Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 20:32</b></font> Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:1</b></font> My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:2</b></font> Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:3</b></font> All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:4</b></font> To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:5</b></font> A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh speedily. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:6</b></font> He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:7</b></font> An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:8</b></font> He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:9</b></font> The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:10</b></font> The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:11</b></font> He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:12</b></font> He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:13</b></font> The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:14</b></font> The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:15</b></font> If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:16</b></font> The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:17</b></font> They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:18</b></font> As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:19</b></font> Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:20</b></font> A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:21</b></font> Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:22</b></font> A foolish man's foot is soon in his neighbour's house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:23</b></font> A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:24</b></font> It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:25</b></font> The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:26</b></font> The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:27</b></font> When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 21:28</b></font> A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:1</b></font> A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone, and every one will hiss him out to his disgrace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:2</b></font> A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: every man that takes it up will shake his hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:3</b></font> An evilnurtured man is the dishonour of his father that begat him: and a foolish daughter is born to his loss. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:4</b></font> A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that liveth dishonestly is her father's heaviness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:5</b></font> She that is bold dishonoureth both her father and her husband, but they both shall despise her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> A tale out of season is as musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are never out of time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shall cover the baseness of their parents. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> But children, being haughty, through disdain and want of nurture do stain the nobility of their kindred. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: and weep for the fool, for he wanteth understanding: make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that hath no understanding: beware of him, lest thou have trouble, and thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, and never be disquieted with madness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, but a fool? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> Pales set on an high place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and he that pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning to favour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:24</b></font> As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire; so reviling before blood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:25</b></font> I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will I hide myself from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:26</b></font> And if any evil happen unto me by him, every one that heareth it will beware of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:27</b></font> Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tongue destroy me not? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> O Lord, Father and Governor of all my whole life, leave me not to their counsels, and let me not fall by them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over mine heart? that they spare me not for mine ignorances, and it pass not by my sins: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> Lest mine ignorances increase, and my sins abound to my destruction, and I fall before mine adversaries, and mine enemy rejoice over me, whose hope is far from thy mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> O Lord, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look, but turn away from thy servants always a haughty mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> Turn away from me vain hopes and concupiscence, and thou shalt hold him up that is desirous always to serve thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold of me; and give not over me thy servant into an impudent mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: he that keepeth it shall never be taken in his lips. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: both the evil speaker and the proud shall fall thereby. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark: so he that sweareth and nameth God continually shall not be faultless. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> A man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin, he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> There is a word that is clothed about with death: God grant that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; for all such things shall be far from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> Use not thy mouth to intemperate swearing, for therein is the word of sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> Remember thy father and thy mother, when thou sittest among great men. Be not forgetful before them, and so thou by thy custom become a fool, and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse they day of thy nativity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will never be reformed all the days of his life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bring wrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he hath kindled a fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> All bread is sweet to a whoremonger, he will not leave off till he die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> A man that breaketh wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Who seeth me? I am compassed about with darkness, the walls cover me, and no body seeth me; what need I to fear? the most High will not remember my sins: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> Such a man only feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> He knew all things ere ever they were created; so also after they were perfected he looked upon them all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:21</b></font> This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and where he suspecteth not he shall be taken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:22</b></font> Thus shall it go also with the wife that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:23</b></font> For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the most High; and secondly, she hath trespassed against her own husband; and thirdly, she hath played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:24</b></font> She shall be brought out into the congregation, and inquisition shall be made of her children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:25</b></font> Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:26</b></font> She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her reproach shall not be blotted out. </font>
