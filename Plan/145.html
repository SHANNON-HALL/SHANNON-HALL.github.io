<font size = "+2"><b>145: Tobit 3:10 - Tobit 7:8</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And now, O Lord, I set mine eyes and my face toward thee, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things for the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> Then she made an end of weeping. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And when they were come near to Rages, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than to any other. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father's and my mother's life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee in marriage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched. </font>
