<font size = "+2"><b>355: Hebrews 9:1 - Hebrews 11:40</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> And having an high priest over the house of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:37</b></font> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:38</b></font> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:39</b></font> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> For by it the elders obtained a good report. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:36</b></font> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:37</b></font> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:38</b></font> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:39</b></font> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:40</b></font> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. </font>
