<font size = "+2"><b>343: 1 Corinthians 15:1 - 2 Corinthians 2:17</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:36</b></font> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:37</b></font> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:38</b></font> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:39</b></font> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:40</b></font> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:41</b></font> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:42</b></font> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:43</b></font> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:44</b></font> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:45</b></font> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:46</b></font> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:47</b></font> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:48</b></font> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:49</b></font> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:50</b></font> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:51</b></font> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:52</b></font> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:53</b></font> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:54</b></font> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:55</b></font> O death, where is thy sting?

or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. </font>
