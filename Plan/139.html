6:18</b></font> And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

7:5</b></font> The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Of the sons of Pahath- moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And I gathered them together to the river than runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this. </font>
