This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> The children of thy elect sister greet thee.

And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> And I will give him the morning star. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
