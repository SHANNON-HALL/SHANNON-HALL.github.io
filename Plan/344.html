<font size = "+2"><b>344: 2 Corinthians 3:1 - 2 Corinthians 8:24</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> So then death worketh in us, but life in you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. </font>
