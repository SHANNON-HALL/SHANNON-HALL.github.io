8:21</b></font> And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

9:19</b></font> These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and Canaan shall be his servant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

10:10</b></font> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

10:24</b></font> And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> But Sarai was barren; she had no child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </font>
