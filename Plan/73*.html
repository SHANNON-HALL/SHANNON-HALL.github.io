<font size = "+2"><b>73: Judges 3:31 - Judges 6:27</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. </font>
