I will even make the pile for fire great. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:23</b></font> And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:24</b></font> Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:25</b></font> Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:26</b></font> That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:27</b></font> In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:8</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:9</b></font> Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:10</b></font> Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:11</b></font> And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:12</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:13</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:14</b></font> And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:15</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:16</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:17</b></font> And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:2</b></font> Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:3</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:4</b></font> And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:5</b></font> It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:6</b></font> And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:7</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:8</b></font> He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:9</b></font> And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:10</b></font> By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:11</b></font> With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:12</b></font> And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:13</b></font> And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:14</b></font> And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:15</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:16</b></font> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:17</b></font> And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:18</b></font> Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:19</b></font> For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:20</b></font> When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 26:21</b></font> I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD. </font>
