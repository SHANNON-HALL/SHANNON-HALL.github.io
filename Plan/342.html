If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> And if they were all one member, where were the body? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> But now are they many members, yet but one body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> Are all apostles?
