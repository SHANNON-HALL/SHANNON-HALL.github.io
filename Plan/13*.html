So Pharaoh awoke. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:5</b></font> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:6</b></font> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:7</b></font> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
