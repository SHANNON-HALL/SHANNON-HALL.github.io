<font size = "+2"><b>57: Deuteronomy 11:10 - Deuteronomy 13:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

12:28</b></font> Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

13:4</b></font> Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God. </font>
