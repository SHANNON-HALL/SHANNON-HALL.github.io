10:3</b></font> And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;

10:14</b></font> In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

10:18</b></font> And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

10:28</b></font> Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:31</b></font> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:32</b></font> And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:33</b></font> And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:34</b></font> And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:35</b></font> And the people journeyed from Kibroth- hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.
