For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:65</b></font> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:66</b></font> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:67</b></font> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:68</b></font> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:69</b></font> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:70</b></font> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:71</b></font> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.

Why go ye about to kill me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:39</b></font> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:40</b></font> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:41</b></font> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:42</b></font> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:43</b></font> So there was a division among the people because of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:44</b></font> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:45</b></font> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:46</b></font> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:47</b></font> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:48</b></font> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:49</b></font> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:50</b></font> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:51</b></font> Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:52</b></font> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:53</b></font> And every man went unto his own house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. </font>
