103:7</b></font> He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:8</b></font> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:9</b></font> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:10</b></font> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:11</b></font> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:12</b></font> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:13</b></font> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:14</b></font> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:15</b></font> As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 103:16</b></font> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
