<font size = "+2"><b>207: Wisdom 1:15 - Wisdom 6:12</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> (For righteousness is immortal:) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> He was made to reprove our thoughts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for the memorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, and with men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fast foundation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years and old age of the unrighteous. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall not understand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and to what end the Lord hath set him in safety. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh them to scorn: and they shall hereafter be a vile carcase, and a reproach among the dead for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, that they shall be speechless; and he shall shake them from the foundation; and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be in sorrow; and their memorial shall perish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shall come with fear: and their own iniquities shall convince them to their face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again, so that a man cannot know where it went through: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but were consumed in our own wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> For the hope of the Godly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord's hand: for with his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of an helmet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> He shall take holiness for an invincible shield. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with him against the unwise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they fly to the mark. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her. </font>
