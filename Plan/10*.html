<font size = "+2"><b>10: Genesis 31:25 - Genesis 34:19</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:25</b></font> Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:26</b></font> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:27</b></font> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:28</b></font> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:29</b></font> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:30</b></font> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:31</b></font> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:32</b></font> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:33</b></font> And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:34</b></font> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:35</b></font> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:36</b></font> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:37</b></font> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:38</b></font> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:39</b></font> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:40</b></font> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:41</b></font> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:42</b></font> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:43</b></font> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:44</b></font> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:45</b></font> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:46</b></font> And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:47</b></font> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:48</b></font> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:49</b></font> And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:50</b></font> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:51</b></font> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:52</b></font> This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:53</b></font> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:54</b></font> Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:55</b></font> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:6</b></font> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:7</b></font> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:8</b></font> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:9</b></font> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:10</b></font> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:11</b></font> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:12</b></font> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:13</b></font> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:14</b></font> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:15</b></font> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:16</b></font> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:17</b></font> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:18</b></font> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:19</b></font> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:20</b></font> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:21</b></font> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:22</b></font> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:23</b></font> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:24</b></font> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:25</b></font> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:26</b></font> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:27</b></font> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:28</b></font> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:29</b></font> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:30</b></font> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:31</b></font> And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:32</b></font> Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:1</b></font> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:2</b></font> And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:12</b></font> And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:13</b></font> And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:1</b></font> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:13</b></font> And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:14</b></font> And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:15</b></font> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:16</b></font> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:17</b></font> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:18</b></font> And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:19</b></font> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. </font>
