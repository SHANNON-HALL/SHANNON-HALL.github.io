And she constrained us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:32</b></font> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:33</b></font> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:34</b></font> And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:35</b></font> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:36</b></font> And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:37</b></font> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:38</b></font> And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:39</b></font> And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:40</b></font> And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:28</b></font> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:29</b></font> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:30</b></font> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:31</b></font> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:32</b></font> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:33</b></font> So Paul departed from among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:34</b></font> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:1</b></font> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:2</b></font> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:3</b></font> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:4</b></font> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:5</b></font> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:6</b></font> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:7</b></font> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:8</b></font> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:9</b></font> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:10</b></font> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:11</b></font> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> And he drave them from the judgment seat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. </font>
