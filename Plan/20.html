And the people bowed the head and worshipped. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:37</b></font> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:38</b></font> And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:39</b></font> And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:40</b></font> Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:41</b></font> And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:42</b></font> It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:43</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:44</b></font> But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:45</b></font> A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:46</b></font> In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:47</b></font> All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:48</b></font> And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:49</b></font> One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:50</b></font> Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:51</b></font> And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> This day came ye out in the month Abib. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD'S. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. </font>
