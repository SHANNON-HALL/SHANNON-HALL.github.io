<font size = "+2"><b>158: 1 Maccabees 5:5 - 1 Maccabees 6:26</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> So he fought many battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled together against us to destroy us: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And they are preparing to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their children also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyed there about a thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> While these letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported on this wise, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consume us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye make not war against the heathen until the time that we come again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country of Galaad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoils he took. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with great joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days' journey in the wilderness, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to the fortress. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> So he went forth behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with prayer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of Galaad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> After these things gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the brook. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembled unto them, even a very great host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:40</b></font> Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:41</b></font> But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:42</b></font> Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to the battle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:43</b></font> So he went first over unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:44</b></font> But they took the city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Judas. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:45</b></font> Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to the end they might come into the land of Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:46</b></font> Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:47</b></font> Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:48</b></font> Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit they would not open unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:49</b></font> Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in the place where he was. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:50</b></font> So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at the length the city was delivered into his hands: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:51</b></font> Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:52</b></font> After this went they over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:53</b></font> And Judas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:54</b></font> So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slain until they had returned in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:55</b></font> Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:56</b></font> Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they had done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:57</b></font> Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round about us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:58</b></font> So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:59</b></font> Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fight against them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:60</b></font> And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:61</b></font> Thus was there a great overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient unto Judas and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:62</b></font> Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:63</b></font> Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:64</b></font> Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:65</b></font> Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:66</b></font> From thence he removed to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:67</b></font> At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that they went out to fight unadvisedly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:68</b></font> So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> About that time king Antiochus travelling through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Grecians, had left there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Wherefore he came and sought to take the city, and to spoil it; but he was not able, because they of the city, having had warning thereof, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and departed thence with great heaviness, and returned to Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Moreover there came one who brought him tidings into Persia, that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were put to flight: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And that Lysias, who went forth first with a great power was driven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten of the armies, whom they had destroyed: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever more and more, and he made account that he should die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he made ruler over all his realm, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to the end he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up for the kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninth year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reign in his stead, and his name he called Eupator. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> About this time they that were in the tower shut up the Israelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them, called all the people together to besiege them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred and fiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, and other engines. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And they went unto the king, and said, How long will it be ere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> We have been willing to serve thy father, and to do as he would have us, and to obey his commandments; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> For which cause they of our nation besiege the tower, and are alienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could light on they slew, and spoiled our inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Neither have they stretched out their hand against us only, but also against their borders. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> And, behold, this day are they besieging the tower at Jerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have they fortified. </font>
