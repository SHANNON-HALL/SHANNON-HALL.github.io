<font size = "+2"><b>272: Ezekiel 40:39 - Ezekiel 43:27</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:39</b></font> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:40</b></font> And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:41</b></font> Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:42</b></font> And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:43</b></font> And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:44</b></font> And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:45</b></font> And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:46</b></font> And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:47</b></font> So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:48</b></font> And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 40:49</b></font> The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:1</b></font> Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:2</b></font> And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:3</b></font> Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:4</b></font> So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:5</b></font> After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:6</b></font> And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:7</b></font> And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:8</b></font> I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:9</b></font> The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:10</b></font> And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:11</b></font> And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:12</b></font> Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:13</b></font> So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:14</b></font> Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:15</b></font> And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:16</b></font> The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:17</b></font> To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:18</b></font> And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:19</b></font> So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:20</b></font> From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:21</b></font> The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:22</b></font> The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:23</b></font> And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:24</b></font> And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:25</b></font> And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 41:26</b></font> And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:1</b></font> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:2</b></font> Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:3</b></font> Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:4</b></font> And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:5</b></font> Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:6</b></font> For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:7</b></font> And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:8</b></font> For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:9</b></font> And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:10</b></font> The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:11</b></font> And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:12</b></font> And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:13</b></font> Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:14</b></font> When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:15</b></font> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:16</b></font> He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:17</b></font> He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:18</b></font> He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:19</b></font> He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 42:20</b></font> He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:1</b></font> Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:2</b></font> And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:3</b></font> And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:4</b></font> And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:5</b></font> So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:6</b></font> And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:7</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:8</b></font> In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:9</b></font> Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:10</b></font> Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:11</b></font> And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:12</b></font> This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:13</b></font> And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:14</b></font> And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:15</b></font> So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:16</b></font> And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:17</b></font> And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:18</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:19</b></font> And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:20</b></font> And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:21</b></font> Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:22</b></font> And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:23</b></font> When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:24</b></font> And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:25</b></font> Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:26</b></font> Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 43:27</b></font> And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD. </font>
