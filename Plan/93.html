<font size = "+2"><b>93: 2 Samuel 6:20 - 2 Samuel 10:19</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more. </font>
