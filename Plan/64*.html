<font size = "+2"><b>64: Deuteronomy 32:44 - Joshua 2:22</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:44</b></font> And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:45</b></font> And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:46</b></font> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:47</b></font> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:48</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:49</b></font> Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:50</b></font> And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:51</b></font> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:52</b></font> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:1</b></font> And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:2</b></font> And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

33:13</b></font> And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:21</b></font> And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:22</b></font> And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:23</b></font> And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:24</b></font> And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:25</b></font> Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. <p><p><p><b>The Book of Joshua</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.
