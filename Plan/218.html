27:27</b></font> He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 27:28</b></font> Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and the sinful man shall have them both. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:1</b></font> He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:2</b></font> Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:3</b></font> One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:4</b></font> He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:5</b></font> If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:6</b></font> Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; remember corruption and death, and abide in the commandments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:7</b></font> Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour: remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:8</b></font> Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a furious man will kindle strife, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:9</b></font> A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:10</b></font> As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:11</b></font> An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:12</b></font> If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:13</b></font> Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:14</b></font> A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:15</b></font> A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived them of their labours. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:16</b></font> Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:17</b></font> The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:18</b></font> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:19</b></font> Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:20</b></font> For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:21</b></font> The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were better than it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:22</b></font> It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neither shall they be burned with the flame thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:23</b></font> Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:24</b></font> Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:25</b></font> And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 28:26</b></font> Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:1</b></font> He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:2</b></font> Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:3</b></font> Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:4</b></font> Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:5</b></font> Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:6</b></font> If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:7</b></font> Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:8</b></font> Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:9</b></font> Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:10</b></font> Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:11</b></font> Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:12</b></font> Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:13</b></font> It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:14</b></font> An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:15</b></font> Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:16</b></font> A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:17</b></font> And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him in danger that delivered him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:18</b></font> Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:19</b></font> A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men's business for gain shall fall into suits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:20</b></font> Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:21</b></font> The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:22</b></font> Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:23</b></font> Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:24</b></font> For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:25</b></font> Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:26</b></font> Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:27</b></font> Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 29:28</b></font> These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:1</b></font> He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:2</b></font> He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:3</b></font> He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:4</b></font> Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:5</b></font> While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:6</b></font> He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:7</b></font> He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled at every cry. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:8</b></font> An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:9</b></font> Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:10</b></font> Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:11</b></font> Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his follies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:12</b></font> Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:13</b></font> Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:14</b></font> Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:15</b></font> Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:16</b></font> There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:17</b></font> Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:18</b></font> Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:19</b></font> What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:20</b></font> He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:21</b></font> Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:22</b></font> The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:23</b></font> Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:24</b></font> Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 30:25</b></font> A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:1</b></font> Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:2</b></font> Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:3</b></font> The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:4</b></font> The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:5</b></font> He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:6</b></font> Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was present. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:7</b></font> It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:8</b></font> Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:9</b></font> Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:10</b></font> Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:11</b></font> His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:12</b></font> If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:13</b></font> Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:14</b></font> Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:15</b></font> Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:16</b></font> Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:17</b></font> Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:18</b></font> When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:19</b></font> A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:20</b></font> Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:21</b></font> And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:22</b></font> My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:23</b></font> Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:24</b></font> But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:25</b></font> Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:26</b></font> The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:27</b></font> Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:28</b></font> Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:29</b></font> But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:30</b></font> Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 31:31</b></font> Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him to drink. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:1</b></font> If thou be made the master of a feast, lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:2</b></font> And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:3</b></font> Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:4</b></font> Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:5</b></font> A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold. </font>
