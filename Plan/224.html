cease to do evil; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
