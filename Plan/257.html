<font size = "+2"><b>257: Baruch 1:14 - Baruch 4:20</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> For we have sinned before the Lord, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sent unto us: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> But every man followed the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that were written in the law of Moses; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto his voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto us and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord hath pronounced against us <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he hath commanded us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And now, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and hast gotten thyself a name, as appeareth this day: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which have led us away: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bow down thine ear, O Lord, to hear us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto your fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thy goodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, crieth unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; ar thou art merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned before thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned before thee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God: for the which cause these plagues cleave unto us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think upon thy power and thy name now at this time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will we praise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hast scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> How happeneth it Israel, that thou art in thine enemies' land, that thou art waxen old in a strange country, that thou art defiled with the dead, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldest have dwelled in peace for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures ? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Young men have seen light, and dwelt upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge unto them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> But he that knoweth all things knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore hath filled it with fourfooted beasts: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth, calleth it again, and it obeyeth him with fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when he calleth them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness they shewed light unto him that made them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:37</b></font> Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Ye were sold to the nations, not for your destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> But what can I help you? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days. </font>
