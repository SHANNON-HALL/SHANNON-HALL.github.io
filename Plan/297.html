This is he which received seed by the way side. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:38</b></font> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:39</b></font> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:40</b></font> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:41</b></font> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:42</b></font> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:43</b></font> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:44</b></font> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:45</b></font> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:46</b></font> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:47</b></font> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:48</b></font> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:49</b></font> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:50</b></font> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:51</b></font> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:52</b></font> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:53</b></font> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:54</b></font> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:55</b></font> Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:56</b></font> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:57</b></font> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:58</b></font> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> He said, Bring them hither to me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:29</b></font> And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:30</b></font> But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:31</b></font> And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:32</b></font> And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:33</b></font> Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:36</b></font> And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </font>
