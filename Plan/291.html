<font size = "+2"><b>291: Zechariah 7:1 - Zechariah 11:14</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from river even to the ends of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. </font>
