Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:38</b></font> Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.
