<font size = "+2"><b>208: Wisdom 6:13 - Wisdom 10:19</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And incorruption maketh us near unto God: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspring of him that was first made of the earth, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And in my mother's womb was fashioned to be flesh in the time of ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure that came with sleep. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay before her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable riches in her hands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them: and I knew not that she was the mother of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I do not hide her riches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> The circuits of years, and the positions of stars: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I know. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:29</b></font> For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:30</b></font> For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> She preserved the first formed father of the world, that was created alone, and brought him out of his fall, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> And gave him power to rule all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger, he perished also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, wisdom again preserved it, and directed the course of the righteous in a piece of wood of small value. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept him strong against his tender compassion toward his son. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good; but also left behind them to the world a memorial of their foolishness: so that in the things wherein they offended they could not so much as be hid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> But wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> When the righteous fled from his brother's wrath she guided him in right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things, made him rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of his labours. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood by him, and made him rich. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> She defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict she gave him the victory; that he might know that goodness is stronger than all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not, but delivered him from sin: she went down with him into the pit, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> And left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptre of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as for them that had accused him, she shewed them to be liars, and gave him perpetual glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed from the nation that oppressed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord, and withstood dreadful kings in wonders and signs; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labours, guided them in a marvellous way, and was unto them for a cover by day, and a light of stars in the night season; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> Brought them through the Red sea, and led them through much water: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> But she drowned their enemies, and cast them up out of the bottom of the deep. </font>
