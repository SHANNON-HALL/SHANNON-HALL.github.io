<font size = "+2"><b>77: Judges 14:10 - Judges 17:6</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. </font>
