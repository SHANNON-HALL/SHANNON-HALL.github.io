And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> But God raised him from the dead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:38</b></font> Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:39</b></font> And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:40</b></font> Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:41</b></font> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:42</b></font> And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:43</b></font> Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:44</b></font> And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:45</b></font> But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:46</b></font> Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:47</b></font> For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:48</b></font> And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:49</b></font> And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:50</b></font> But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:51</b></font> But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:52</b></font> And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> And there they preached the gospel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:13</b></font> Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:14</b></font> Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:15</b></font> And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:16</b></font> Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:17</b></font> Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:18</b></font> And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:19</b></font> And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:20</b></font> Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:21</b></font> And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:23</b></font> And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:24</b></font> And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:25</b></font> And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:26</b></font> And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:27</b></font> And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:28</b></font> And there they abode long time with the disciples. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:33</b></font> And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:34</b></font> Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:35</b></font> Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </font>
