<font size = "+2"><b>53: Numbers 36:1 - Deuteronomy 2:25</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:1</b></font> And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:2</b></font> And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:7</b></font> So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:8</b></font> And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:9</b></font> Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:10</b></font> Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:11</b></font> For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:12</b></font> And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:13</b></font> These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. <p><p><p><b>The Fifth Book of Moses, called Deuteronomy</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> and the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:43</b></font> So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:44</b></font> And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:45</b></font> And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:46</b></font> So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> And the LORD spake unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> That the LORD spake unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. </font>
