<font size = "+2"><b>312: Luke 8:41 - Luke 10:22</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:41</b></font> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:42</b></font> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:43</b></font> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:44</b></font> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:45</b></font> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:46</b></font> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:47</b></font> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:48</b></font> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:49</b></font> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:50</b></font> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:51</b></font> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:52</b></font> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:53</b></font> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:54</b></font> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:55</b></font> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:56</b></font> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And they did so, and made them all sit down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:33</b></font> And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:34</b></font> While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:35</b></font> And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:36</b></font> And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:37</b></font> And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:38</b></font> And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:39</b></font> And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:40</b></font> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:41</b></font> And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:42</b></font> And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:43</b></font> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:44</b></font> Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:45</b></font> But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:46</b></font> Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:47</b></font> And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:48</b></font> And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:49</b></font> And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:50</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:51</b></font> And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:52</b></font> And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:53</b></font> And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:54</b></font> And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:55</b></font> But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:56</b></font> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:57</b></font> And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:58</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:59</b></font> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:60</b></font> Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:61</b></font> And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:62</b></font> And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. </font>
