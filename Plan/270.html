<font size = "+2"><b>270: Ezekiel 36:1 - Ezekiel 38:13</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:1</b></font> Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:2</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:7</b></font> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:8</b></font> But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:9</b></font> For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:10</b></font> And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:11</b></font> And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:12</b></font> Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:13</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:14</b></font> Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:15</b></font> Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:16</b></font> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:17</b></font> Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:18</b></font> Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:19</b></font> And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:20</b></font> And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:21</b></font> But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:22</b></font> Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:23</b></font> And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:24</b></font> For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:25</b></font> Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:26</b></font> A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:27</b></font> And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:28</b></font> And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:29</b></font> I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:30</b></font> And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:31</b></font> Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:32</b></font> Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:33</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:34</b></font> And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:35</b></font> And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:36</b></font> Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:37</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:38</b></font> As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:1</b></font> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:2</b></font> And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:7</b></font> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:8</b></font> And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:9</b></font> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:10</b></font> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:11</b></font> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:12</b></font> Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:13</b></font> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:14</b></font> And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:15</b></font> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:16</b></font> Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:17</b></font> And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:18</b></font> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:19</b></font> Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:20</b></font> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:21</b></font> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:22</b></font> And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:23</b></font> Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:24</b></font> And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:25</b></font> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:26</b></font> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:27</b></font> My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:28</b></font> And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:1</b></font> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:2</b></font> Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:3</b></font> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:4</b></font> And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:5</b></font> Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:6</b></font> Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:7</b></font> Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:8</b></font> After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:9</b></font> Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:10</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:11</b></font> And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:12</b></font> To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 38:13</b></font> Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil?
