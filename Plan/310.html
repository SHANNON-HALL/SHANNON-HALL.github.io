<font size = "+2"><b>310: Luke 4:14 - Luke 6:45</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> But he passing through the midst of them went his way, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:25</b></font> And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:26</b></font> And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:27</b></font> And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:28</b></font> And he left all, rose up, and followed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:29</b></font> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:30</b></font> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:31</b></font> And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:32</b></font> I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:33</b></font> And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:34</b></font> And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:35</b></font> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:36</b></font> And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:37</b></font> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:38</b></font> But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:39</b></font> No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:38</b></font> Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:39</b></font> And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:40</b></font> The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:41</b></font> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:42</b></font> Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:43</b></font> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:44</b></font> For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:45</b></font> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. </font>
