<font size = "+2"><b>27: Exodus 32:15 - Exodus 35:3</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:15</b></font> And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:16</b></font> And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:17</b></font> And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:18</b></font> And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:19</b></font> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:20</b></font> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:21</b></font> And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:22</b></font> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:23</b></font> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:24</b></font> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:25</b></font> And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:26</b></font> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:27</b></font> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:28</b></font> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:29</b></font> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:30</b></font> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:31</b></font> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:32</b></font> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:33</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:34</b></font> Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 32:35</b></font> And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:1</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:2</b></font> And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:3</b></font> Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:4</b></font> And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:5</b></font> For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:6</b></font> And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:7</b></font> And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:8</b></font> And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:9</b></font> And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:10</b></font> And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:11</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:12</b></font> And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:13</b></font> Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:14</b></font> And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:15</b></font> And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:16</b></font> For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:17</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:18</b></font> And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:19</b></font> And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:20</b></font> And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:21</b></font> And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:22</b></font> And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 33:23</b></font> And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:1</b></font> And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:3</b></font> And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:4</b></font> And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:5</b></font> And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:7</b></font> Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:8</b></font> And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:9</b></font> And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:10</b></font> And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:11</b></font> Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:12</b></font> Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:13</b></font> But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:14</b></font> For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:15</b></font> Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:16</b></font> And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:17</b></font> Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:18</b></font> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep.
