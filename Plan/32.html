7:23</b></font> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

7:30</b></font> His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:31</b></font> And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:32</b></font> And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:33</b></font> He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:34</b></font> For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:35</b></font> This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:36</b></font> Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:37</b></font> This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:38</b></font> Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. </font>
