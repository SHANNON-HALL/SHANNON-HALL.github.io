<font size = "+2"><b>275: Daniel 1:8 - Daniel 3:18</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:11</b></font> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:12</b></font> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:13</b></font> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:14</b></font> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:15</b></font> He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:16</b></font> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:19</b></font> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:20</b></font> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:37</b></font> Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:38</b></font> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:39</b></font> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:40</b></font> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:41</b></font> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:42</b></font> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:43</b></font> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:44</b></font> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:45</b></font> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:46</b></font> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:47</b></font> The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:48</b></font> Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:49</b></font> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. </font>
