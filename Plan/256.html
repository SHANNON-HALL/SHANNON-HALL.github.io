Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> For the Lord will not cast off for ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:37</b></font> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:38</b></font> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:39</b></font> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:40</b></font> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:41</b></font> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:42</b></font> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:43</b></font> Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:44</b></font> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:45</b></font> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:46</b></font> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:47</b></font> Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:48</b></font> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:49</b></font> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:50</b></font> Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:51</b></font> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:52</b></font> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:53</b></font> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:54</b></font> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:55</b></font> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:56</b></font> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:57</b></font> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:58</b></font> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:59</b></font> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:60</b></font> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:61</b></font> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:62</b></font> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:63</b></font> Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:64</b></font> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:65</b></font> Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:66</b></font> Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. <p><p><p><b>The Book of Baruch</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> They made also a collection of money according to every man's power: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;
