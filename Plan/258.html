4:22</b></font> For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

and set a diadem on thine head of the glory of the Everlasting. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> For God will shew thy brightness unto every country under heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

5:6</b></font> For they departed from thee on foot, and were led away of their enemies: but God bringeth them unto thee exalted with glory, as children of the kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> For God hath appointed that every high hill, and banks of long continuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Moreover even the woods and every sweetsmelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him. <p><p><p><b>The Epistle or Letter of Jeremiah Jeremy</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> A copy of an epistle, which Jeremy sent unto them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Because of the sins which ye have committed before God, ye shall be led away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> So when ye be come unto Babylon, ye shall remain there many years, and for a long season, namely, seven generations: and after that I will bring you away peaceably from thence. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> Now shall ye see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause the nations to fear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Beware therefore that ye in no wise be like to strangers, neither be ye and of them, when ye see the multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> But say ye in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> For mine angel is with you, and I myself caring for your souls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> As for their tongue, it is polished by the workman, and they themselves are gilded and laid over with silver; yet are they but false, and cannot speak. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for the heads of their gods. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Yea, they will give thereof to the common harlots, and deck them as men with garments, being gods of silver, and gods of gold, and wood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> Yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth, though they be covered with purple raiment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, when there is much upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And he that cannot put to death one that offendeth him holdeth a sceptre, as though he were a judge of the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> He hath also in his right hand a dagger and an ax: but cannot deliver himself from war and thieves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> For like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in the temple, their eyes be full of dust through the feet of them that come in. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> And as the doors are made sure on every side upon him that offendeth the king, as being committed to suffer death: even so the priests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest their gods be spoiled with robbers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> They light them candles, yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see one. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> They are as one of the beams of the temple, yet they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping out of the earth; and when they eat them and their clothes, they feel it not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Their faces are blacked through the smoke that cometh out of the temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> Upon their bodies and heads sit bats, swallows, and birds, and the cats also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> By this ye may know that they are no gods: therefore fear them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> Notwithstanding the gold that is about them to make them beautiful, except they wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten did they feel it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> The things wherein there is no breath are bought for a most high price. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> They are borne upon shoulders, having no feet whereby they declare unto men that they be nothing worth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they cannot rise up again of themselves: neither, if one set them upright, can they move of themselves: neither, if they be bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but they set gifts before them as unto dead men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> As for the things that are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse; in like manner their wives lay up part thereof in salt; but unto the poor and impotent they give nothing of it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> Menstruous women and women in childbed eat their sacrifices: by these things ye may know that they are no gods: fear them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> For how can they be called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> And the priests sit in their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> The priests also take off their garments, and clothe their wives and children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> Whether it be evil that one doeth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor put him down. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow unto them, and keep it not, they will not require it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor help any man in his distress. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:38</b></font> They can shew no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:39</b></font> Their gods of wood, and which are overlaid with gold and silver, are like the stones that be hewn out of the mountain: they that worship them shall be confounded. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:40</b></font> How should a man then think and say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:41</b></font> Who if they shall see one dumb that cannot speak, they bring him, and intreat Bel that he may speak, as though he were able to understand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:42</b></font> Yet they cannot understand this themselves, and leave them: for they have no knowledge. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:43</b></font> The women also with cords about them, sitting in the ways, burn bran for perfume: but if any of them, drawn by some that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:44</b></font> Whatsoever is done among them is false: how may it then be thought or said that they are gods? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:45</b></font> They are made of carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will have them to be. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:46</b></font> And they themselves that made them can never continue long; how should then the things that are made of them be gods? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:47</b></font> For they left lies and reproaches to them that come after. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:48</b></font> For when there cometh any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:49</b></font> How then cannot men perceive that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war, nor from plague? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:50</b></font> For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with silver and gold, it shall be known hereafter that they are false: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:51</b></font> And it shall manifestly appear to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:52</b></font> Who then may not know that they are no gods? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:53</b></font> For neither can they set up a king in the land, nor give rain unto men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:54</b></font> Neither can they judge their own cause, nor redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows between heaven and earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:55</b></font> Whereupon when fire falleth upon the house of gods of wood, or laid over with gold or silver, their priests will flee away, and escape; but they themselves shall be burned asunder like beams. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:56</b></font> Moreover they cannot withstand any king or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that they be gods? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:57</b></font> Neither are those gods of wood, and laid over with silver or gold, able to escape either from thieves or robbers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:58</b></font> Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong take, and go away withal: neither are they able to help themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:59</b></font> Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power, or else a profitable vessel in an house, which the owner shall have use of, than such false gods; or to be a door in an house, to keep such things therein, than such false gods. or a pillar of wood in a a palace, than such false gods. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:60</b></font> For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:61</b></font> In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to be seen; and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:62</b></font> And when God commandeth the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are bidden. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:63</b></font> And the fire sent from above to consume hills and woods doeth as it is commanded: but these are like unto them neither in shew nor power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:64</b></font> Wherefore it is neither to be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do good unto men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:65</b></font> Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:66</b></font> For they can neither curse nor bless kings: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:67</b></font> Neither can they shew signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:68</b></font> The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:69</b></font> It is then by no means manifest unto us that they are gods: therefore fear them not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:70</b></font> For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing: so are their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:71</b></font> And likewise their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold, are like to a white thorn in an orchard, that every bird sitteth upon; as also to a dead body, that is east into the dark. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:72</b></font> And ye shall know them to be no gods by the bright purple that rotteth upon then1: and they themselves afterward shall be eaten, and shall be a reproach in the country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:73</b></font> Better therefore is the just man that hath none idols: for he shall be far from reproach. <p><p><p><b>The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. </font>
