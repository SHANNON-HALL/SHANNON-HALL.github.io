the world, and all things that come forth of it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:2</b></font> For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

34:5</b></font> For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 34:6</b></font> The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

36:1</b></font> Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:2</b></font> And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:3</b></font> Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:4</b></font> And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:5</b></font> I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:6</b></font> Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:7</b></font> But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:8</b></font> Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:9</b></font> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:10</b></font> And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:11</b></font> Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:12</b></font> But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:13</b></font> Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:14</b></font> Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:15</b></font> Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:16</b></font> Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:17</b></font> Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:18</b></font> Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:19</b></font> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:20</b></font> Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:21</b></font> But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 36:22</b></font> Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:2</b></font> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:3</b></font> And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:4</b></font> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:5</b></font> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:6</b></font> And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:7</b></font> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:8</b></font> So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:9</b></font> And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:10</b></font> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:11</b></font> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:12</b></font> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:13</b></font> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:14</b></font> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:15</b></font> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:16</b></font> O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:17</b></font> Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:18</b></font> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:19</b></font> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:20</b></font> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:21</b></font> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:22</b></font> This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:23</b></font> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:24</b></font> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:25</b></font> I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:26</b></font> Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:27</b></font> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:28</b></font> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:29</b></font> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:30</b></font> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:31</b></font> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:32</b></font> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:33</b></font> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:34</b></font> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:35</b></font> For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 37:36</b></font> Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. </font>
