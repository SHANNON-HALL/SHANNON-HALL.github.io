<font size = "+2"><b>166: 2 Maccabees 2:24 - 2 Maccabees 4:32</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty which they find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for the variety of the matter, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> We have been careful, that they that will read may have delight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memory might have ease, and that all into whose hands it comes might have profit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> Therefore to us, that have taken upon us this painful labour of abridging, it was not easy, but a matter of sweat and watching; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, and seeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many we will undertake gladly this great pains; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular, and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> For as the master builder of a new house must care for the whole building; but he that undertaketh to set it out, and paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning thereof: even so I think it is with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> To stand upon every point, and go over things at large, and to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of the story: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> But to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, is to be granted to him that will make an abridgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> Here then will we begin the story: only adding thus much to that which hath been said, that it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place, and magnify the temple with their best gifts; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius the son of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches, which did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into the king's hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him of the money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaid money. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour of visiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king's purpose. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligence was given of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked if these things were so indeed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Then the high priest told him that there was such money laid up for the relief of widows and fatherless children: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a man of great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum whereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs should be done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place, and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him, said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king's treasury. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order this matter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a law concerning things given to he kept, that they should safely be preserved for such as had committed them to be kept. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it would have wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of his colour declared the inward agony of his mind. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow he had now in his heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> Others ran flocking out of their houses to the general supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts, abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down of the multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being in such an agony. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things committed of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> Now as he was there present himself with his guard about the treasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of gold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable in strength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by him on either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sore stripes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with great darkness: but they that were with him took him up, and put him into a litter. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with all his guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable to help himself with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged the power of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechless without all hope of life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayed Onias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to give up the ghost. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:32</b></font> So the high priest, suspecting lest the king should misconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:33</b></font> Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the same young men in the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:34</b></font> And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken these words, they appeared no more. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:35</b></font> So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned with his host to the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:36</b></font> Then testified he to all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:37</b></font> And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:38</b></font> If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:39</b></font> For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place, and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:40</b></font> And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this sort. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of the laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon's faction murders were committed, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and that Apollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increase Simon's malice, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but seeking the good of all, both publick and private: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For he saw that it was impossible that the state should continue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did look thereunto. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and for the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into his hand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekish fashion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And the royal privileges granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down the governments which were according to the law, he brought up new customs against the law: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> For he built gladly a place of exercise under the tower itself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection, and made them wear a hat. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> That the priests had no courage to serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place of exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they had them to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed so earnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the laws of God: but the time following shall declare these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to be reserved for other charges. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed to Hercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it was employed to the making of gallies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence to Jerusalem: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city, and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings: and so afterward went with his host unto Phenice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> So he came with the king's mandate, bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being undermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of the Ammonites. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs. Wherefore they were both called before the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because they were given to the king's concubine, called Antiochus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time, stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave some of them to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about. </font>
