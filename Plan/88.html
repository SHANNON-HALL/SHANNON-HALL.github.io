Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:6</b></font> When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:7</b></font> Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:8</b></font> That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:9</b></font> Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:10</b></font> And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:11</b></font> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:12</b></font> And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:13</b></font> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:14</b></font> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:15</b></font> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:16</b></font> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:17</b></font> And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:18</b></font> And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:19</b></font> And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:20</b></font> And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:21</b></font> And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:22</b></font> And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 22:23</b></font> Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:1</b></font> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:2</b></font> Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:3</b></font> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:4</b></font> Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:5</b></font> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:6</b></font> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:7</b></font> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:8</b></font> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:9</b></font> And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:10</b></font> Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:11</b></font> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:12</b></font> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:13</b></font> Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:14</b></font> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:15</b></font> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:16</b></font> And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:17</b></font> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:18</b></font> And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:19</b></font> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:20</b></font> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:21</b></font> And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:22</b></font> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:23</b></font> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:24</b></font> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:25</b></font> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:26</b></font> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:27</b></font> But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:28</b></font> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela- hammahlekoth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:29</b></font> And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:11</b></font> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:12</b></font> The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:13</b></font> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:14</b></font> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:15</b></font> The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:16</b></font> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:17</b></font> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:18</b></font> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:19</b></font> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:20</b></font> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:21</b></font> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:22</b></font> And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. </font>
