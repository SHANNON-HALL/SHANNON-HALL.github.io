<font size = "+2"><b>338: Romans 8:1 - Romans 11:12</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:35</b></font> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:36</b></font> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:37</b></font> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:38</b></font> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:39</b></font> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:33</b></font> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? </font>
