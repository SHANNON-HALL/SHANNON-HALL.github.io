<font size = "+2"><b>211: Wisdom 18:12 - Sirach 2:16</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:12</b></font> So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:13</b></font> For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of the enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:14</b></font> For while all things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:15</b></font> Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:16</b></font> And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:17</b></font> Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore, and terrors came upon them unlooked for. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:18</b></font> And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:19</b></font> For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:20</b></font> Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, and there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but the wrath endured not long. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:21</b></font> For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:22</b></font> So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, nor force of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:23</b></font> For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one upon another, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted the way to the living. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:24</b></font> For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thy Majesty upon the daidem of his head. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 18:25</b></font> Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:1</b></font> As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end: for he knew before what they would do; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:2</b></font> How that having given them leave to depart, and sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:3</b></font> For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:4</b></font> For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to their torments: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:5</b></font> And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but they might find a strange death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:6</b></font> For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:7</b></font> As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:8</b></font> Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:9</b></font> For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:10</b></font> For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:11</b></font> But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:12</b></font> For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:13</b></font> And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behaviour toward strangers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:14</b></font> For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:15</b></font> And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:16</b></font> But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the same laws with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:17</b></font> Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his own doors. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:18</b></font> For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:19</b></font> For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:20</b></font> The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:21</b></font> On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 19:22</b></font> For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place. <p><p><p><b>The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus</b> <p>A Prologue made by an uncertain Author <p>This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the same name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, after the people had been led away captive, and called home a again, and almost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it both by his own name, his father's name, and his grandfather's; alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also. <p>The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. <p>Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?

or who hath known her wise counsels? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who hath understood her great experience? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath given her to them that love him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favour in the day of his death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with her fruits. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding standing, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed what thou speakest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:1</b></font> My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:2</b></font> Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:3</b></font> Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:4</b></font> Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:5</b></font> For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:6</b></font> Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:7</b></font> Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:8</b></font> Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:9</b></font> Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:10</b></font> Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded?
