<font size = "+2"><b>280: The Prayer of Azariah (in Daniel) 1:1 - The Book of Bel and the Dragon (in Daniel) 1:32</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><p><p><b>The History of Susanna in Daniel</b> <p>Set apart from the beginning of Daniel, because it is not in the Hebrew, as neither the Narration of Bel and the Dragon. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband's garden to walk. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape your hands. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Then ran the one, and opened the garden door. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> So she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:33</b></font> Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:34</b></font> Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:35</b></font> And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:36</b></font> And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:37</b></font> Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:38</b></font> Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness, ran unto them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:39</b></font> And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:40</b></font> But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:41</b></font> Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders and judges of the people: so they condemned her to death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:42</b></font> Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:43</b></font> Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:44</b></font> And the Lord heard her voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:45</b></font> Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:46</b></font> Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:47</b></font> Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast spoken? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:48</b></font> So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools, ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:49</b></font> Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:50</b></font> Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:51</b></font> Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:52</b></font> So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:53</b></font> For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemned the innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:54</b></font> Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what tree sawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick tree. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:55</b></font> And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine own head; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:56</b></font> So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:57</b></font> Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:58</b></font> Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them companying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:59</b></font> Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in two, that he may destroy you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:60</b></font> With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them that trust in him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:61</b></font> And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:62</b></font> And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in such sort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and they put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:63</b></font> Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:64</b></font> From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight of the people. <p><p><p><b>The Book of Bel and the Dragon in Daniel</b> <p>The History of the Destruction of Bel and the Dragon, Cut off from the end of Daniel. <p><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honoured above all his friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Now the Babylons had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> Then Daniel smiled, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink any thing. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> So the king was wroth, and called for his priests, and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these expences, ye shall die. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> But if ye can certify me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according to thy word. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> So Bel's priests said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast and seal it with thine own signet; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> And to morrow when thou comest in, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king's signet, and so departed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> And as soon as he had opened the dour, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> And took the priests with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel's power, who destroyed him and his temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:25</b></font> Then said Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:26</b></font> But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give thee leave. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:27</b></font> Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon's mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder : and Daniel said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:28</b></font> When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain the dragon, and put the priests to death. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:29</b></font> So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine house. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:30</b></font> Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:31</b></font> Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:32</b></font> And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel. </font>
