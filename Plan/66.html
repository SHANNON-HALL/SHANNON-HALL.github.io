And the men went up and viewed Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:23</b></font> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:24</b></font> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:25</b></font> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:26</b></font> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. </font>
