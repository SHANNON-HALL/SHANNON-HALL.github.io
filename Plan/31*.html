It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

6:24</b></font> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

7:5</b></font> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. </font>
