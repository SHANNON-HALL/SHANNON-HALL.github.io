12:13</b></font> As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have fought against us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in these wars: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your prosperity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are our's, and our's are your's We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report unto you on this wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:24</b></font> Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius' princes were come to fight against him with a greater host than afore, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:25</b></font> He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:26</b></font> He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:27</b></font> Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round about the host. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:28</b></font> But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:29</b></font> Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:30</b></font> Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river Eleutherus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:31</b></font> Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:32</b></font> And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:33</b></font> Simon also went forth, and passed through the country unto Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:34</b></font> For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto them that took Demetrius' part; wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:35</b></font> After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:36</b></font> And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:37</b></font> Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:38</b></font> Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:39</b></font> Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:40</b></font> Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and came to Bethsan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:41</b></font> Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:42</b></font> Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, he durst not stretch his hand against him; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:43</b></font> But received him honourably, and commended him unto all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be as obedient unto him, as to himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:44</b></font> Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:45</b></font> Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to wait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will give it thee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the cause of my coming. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:46</b></font> So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:47</b></font> And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:48</b></font> Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came with him they slew with the sword. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:49</b></font> Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's company. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:50</b></font> But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went close together, prepared to fight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:51</b></font> They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:52</b></font> Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great lamentation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:53</b></font> Then all the heathen that were round about then sought to destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away their memorial from among men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a great host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know what great things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which we have seen. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel's sake, and I am left alone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and our wives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to destroy us of very malice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spirit revived. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt be our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us, that will we do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> So then he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him a great power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein remained there in it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power to invade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers unto him, saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for money that he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning the business that was committed unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will let him go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spake deceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children, lest peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred of the people: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Jonathan dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:19</b></font> So he sent them the children and the hundred talents: howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:20</b></font> And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroy it, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: but Simon and his host marched against him in every place, wheresoever he went. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:21</b></font> Now they that were in the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by the wilderness, and send them victuals. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:22</b></font> Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he came not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:23</b></font> And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who was buried there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:24</b></font> Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:25</b></font> Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:26</b></font> And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:27</b></font> Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:28</b></font> Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:29</b></font> And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour for a perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they might be seen of all that sail on the sea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:30</b></font> This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:31</b></font> Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and slew him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:32</b></font> And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:33</b></font> Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars, and laid up victuals therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:34</b></font> Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to spoil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:35</b></font> Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after this manner: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:36</b></font> King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:37</b></font> The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the immunities which we have granted. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:38</b></font> And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand; and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:39</b></font> As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be paid. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:40</b></font> And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let then be enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:41</b></font> Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:42</b></font> Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, the governor and leader of the Jews. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:43</b></font> In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:44</b></font> And they that were in the engine leaped into the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the city: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:45</b></font> Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:46</b></font> And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:47</b></font> So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and thanksgiving. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:48</b></font> Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:49</b></font> They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:50</b></font> Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one with them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:51</b></font> And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:52</b></font> He ordained also that that day should be kept every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with his company. </font>
