Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:27</b></font> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:28</b></font> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:29</b></font> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:30</b></font> And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:31</b></font> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:32</b></font> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:33</b></font> And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:34</b></font> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> And he arose, and departed to his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:8</b></font> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:9</b></font> And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:10</b></font> And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:11</b></font> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:12</b></font> But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:13</b></font> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:14</b></font> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:15</b></font> And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:16</b></font> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:17</b></font> Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:18</b></font> While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:19</b></font> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:20</b></font> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:21</b></font> For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:22</b></font> But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:23</b></font> And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:24</b></font> He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:25</b></font> But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:26</b></font> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?
