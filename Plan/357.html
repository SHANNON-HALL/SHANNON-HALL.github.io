Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. <p><p><p><b>The First Epistle General of Peter</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:1</b></font> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:2</b></font> Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:3</b></font> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:4</b></font> To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:5</b></font> Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:6</b></font> Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:7</b></font> That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:8</b></font> Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:9</b></font> Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:10</b></font> Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:11</b></font> Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:12</b></font> Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:13</b></font> Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:14</b></font> As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:15</b></font> But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:16</b></font> Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:17</b></font> And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:18</b></font> Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:19</b></font> But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:20</b></font> Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:21</b></font> Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:22</b></font> Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:23</b></font> Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 1:24</b></font> For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.

but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:21</b></font> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:22</b></font> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:23</b></font> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:24</b></font> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:25</b></font> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. </font>
