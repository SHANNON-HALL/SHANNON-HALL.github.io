<font size = "+2"><b>315: Luke 14:34 - Luke 17:37</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:34</b></font> Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:35</b></font> It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:1</b></font> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:2</b></font> And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:3</b></font> And he spake this parable unto them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:4</b></font> What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:5</b></font> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:6</b></font> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:7</b></font> I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:8</b></font> Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:11</b></font> And he said, A certain man had two sons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:12</b></font> And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:24</b></font> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:25</b></font> Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:26</b></font> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:27</b></font> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:28</b></font> And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:29</b></font> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:30</b></font> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:31</b></font> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:32</b></font> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:14</b></font> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:15</b></font> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:17</b></font> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:18</b></font> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:19</b></font> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:20</b></font> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:21</b></font> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:22</b></font> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:23</b></font> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:24</b></font> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:25</b></font> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:26</b></font> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:27</b></font> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:28</b></font> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:29</b></font> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:30</b></font> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:31</b></font> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:1</b></font> Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:2</b></font> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:3</b></font> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:4</b></font> And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:5</b></font> And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:6</b></font> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:7</b></font> But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:8</b></font> And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:9</b></font> Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:10</b></font> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:11</b></font> And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:12</b></font> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:13</b></font> And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:14</b></font> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:15</b></font> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:16</b></font> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:17</b></font> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:18</b></font> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:19</b></font> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:20</b></font> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:21</b></font> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:22</b></font> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:23</b></font> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:24</b></font> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:25</b></font> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:26</b></font> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:27</b></font> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:28</b></font> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:29</b></font> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:30</b></font> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:31</b></font> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:32</b></font> Remember Lot's wife. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:33</b></font> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:34</b></font> I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:35</b></font> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:36</b></font> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 17:37</b></font> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?
