<font size = "+2"><b>54: Deuteronomy 2:26 - Deuteronomy 4:40</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:26</b></font> And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:27</b></font> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:28</b></font> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:29</b></font> (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:30</b></font> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:31</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:32</b></font> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:33</b></font> And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:34</b></font> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:35</b></font> Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:36</b></font> From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:37</b></font> Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan- havoth-jair, unto this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> And I gave Gilead unto Machir. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> So we abode in the valley over against Beth- peor. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever. </font>
