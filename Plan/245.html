What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:29</b></font> Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:30</b></font> Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:31</b></font> Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:32</b></font> Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:33</b></font> And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:34</b></font> And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:35</b></font> Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:36</b></font> And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:37</b></font> Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:38</b></font> But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:39</b></font> Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 23:40</b></font> And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:1</b></font> The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:2</b></font> One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:3</b></font> Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:4</b></font> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:5</b></font> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:6</b></font> For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:7</b></font> And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:8</b></font> And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:9</b></font> And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 24:10</b></font> And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:1</b></font> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:2</b></font> The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:3</b></font> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:4</b></font> And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:5</b></font> They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:6</b></font> And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 25:7</b></font> Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. </font>
