Then said I, Here am I; send me. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:13</b></font> Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:14</b></font> And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:15</b></font> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:16</b></font> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:17</b></font> And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:18</b></font> Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:19</b></font> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:20</b></font> To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:21</b></font> And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:22</b></font> And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:1</b></font> Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:2</b></font> The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:3</b></font> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:4</b></font> For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:5</b></font> For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:6</b></font> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:7</b></font> Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.
