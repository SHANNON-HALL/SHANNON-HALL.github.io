The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:18</b></font> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:19</b></font> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:20</b></font> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:21</b></font> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:22</b></font> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:23</b></font> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:24</b></font> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:25</b></font> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:26</b></font> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:27</b></font> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:28</b></font> Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:1</b></font> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:2</b></font> And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:3</b></font> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:4</b></font> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:5</b></font> And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:6</b></font> And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:7</b></font> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:8</b></font> Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:9</b></font> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:10</b></font> And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:11</b></font> Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 8:12</b></font> And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. </font>
