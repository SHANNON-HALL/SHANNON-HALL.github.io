Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:27</b></font> The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:28</b></font> And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:29</b></font> Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:30</b></font> And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:31</b></font> To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 9:32</b></font> And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed. <p><p><p><b>The Rest of the Chapters of the Book of Esther</b> <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these things. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> A little fountain became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And the two dragons are I and Aman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> And my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of judgment, before God among all nations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, according to the generations for ever among his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had interpreted it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> In the second year of the reign of Artexerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the son of Jairus, the son of Semei, the son of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the king's court. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> He was also one of the captives, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Judea; and this was his dream: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> Behold a noise of a tumult, with thunder, and earthquakes, and uproar in the land: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> And, behold, two great dragons came forth ready to fight, and their cry was great. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And at their cry all nations were prepared to battle, that they might fight against the righteous people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> And lo a day of darkness and obscurity, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great uproar, upon earth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own evils, and were ready to perish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the glorious. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what God had determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artexerxes the king; and so he certified the king of them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed it, they were strangled. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And the king made a record of these things, and Mardocheus also wrote thereof. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> So the king commanded, Mardocheus to serve in the court, and for this he rewarded him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus the Agagite, who was in great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:1</b></font> The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artexerxes writeth these things to the princes and governours that are under him from India unto Ethiopia in an hundred and seven and twenty provinces. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:2</b></font> After that I became lord over many nations and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:3</b></font> Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:4</b></font> Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us cannot go forward. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:5</b></font> Seeing then we understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange manner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmly established: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:6</b></font> Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:7</b></font> That they, who of old and now also are malicious, may in one day with violence go into the grave, and so ever hereafter cause our affairs to be well settled, and without trouble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:8</b></font> Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, and made his prayer unto him, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:9</b></font> Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole world is in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay thee: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:10</b></font> For thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous things under the heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:11</b></font> Thou art Lord of all things, and and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:12</b></font> Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:13</b></font> For I could have been content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:14</b></font> But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God, neither will I do it in pride. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:15</b></font> And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy the inheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:16</b></font> Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out of Egypt for thine own self. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:17</b></font> Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turn our sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thy name: and destroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, O Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 13:18</b></font> All Israel in like manner cried most earnestly unto the Lord, because their death was before their eyes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:1</b></font> Queen Esther also, being in fear of death, resorted unto the Lord: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:2</b></font> And laid away her glorious apparel, and put on the garments of anguish and mourning: and instead of precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body greatly, and all the places of her joy she filled with her torn hair. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:3</b></font> And she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lord, thou only art our King: help me, desolate woman, which have no helper but thee: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:4</b></font> For my danger is in mine hand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:5</b></font> From my youth up I have heard in the tribe of my family that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from all their predecessors, for a perpetual inheritance, and thou hast performed whatsoever thou didst promise them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:6</b></font> And now we have sinned before thee: therefore hast thou given us into the hands of our enemies, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:7</b></font> Because we worshipped their gods: O Lord, thou art righteous. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:8</b></font> Nevertheless it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captivity: but they have stricken hands with their idols, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:9</b></font> That they will abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordained, and destroy thine inheritance, and stop the mouth of them that praise thee, and quench the glory of thy house, and of thine altar, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:10</b></font> And open the mouths of the heathen to set forth the praises of the idols, and to magnify a fleshly king for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:11</b></font> O Lord, give not thy sceptre unto them that be nothing, and let them not laugh at our fall; but turn their device upon themselves, and make him an example, that hath begun this against us. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:12</b></font> Remember, O Lord, make thyself known in time of our affliction, and give me boldness, O King of the nations, and Lord of all power. </font>
