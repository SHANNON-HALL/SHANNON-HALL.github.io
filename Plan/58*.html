Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 14:22</b></font> Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

15:8</b></font> But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:9</b></font> Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:10</b></font> Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

15:12</b></font> And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:13</b></font> And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:14</b></font> Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:15</b></font> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:16</b></font> And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:17</b></font> Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:18</b></font> It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:19</b></font> All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:20</b></font> Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:21</b></font> And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:22</b></font> Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 15:23</b></font> Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:1</b></font> Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:2</b></font> Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:3</b></font> Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:4</b></font> And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:5</b></font> Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:6</b></font> But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:7</b></font> And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:8</b></font> Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:9</b></font> Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:10</b></font> And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:11</b></font> And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:12</b></font> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:13</b></font> Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

16:15</b></font> Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 16:16</b></font> Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

So thou shalt put the evil away from among you. </font>
