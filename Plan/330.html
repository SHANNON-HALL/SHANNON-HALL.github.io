<font size = "+2"><b>330: Acts of the Apostles 10:1 - Acts of the Apostles 12:23</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:1</b></font> There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:2</b></font> A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:3</b></font> He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:4</b></font> And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:5</b></font> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:6</b></font> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:7</b></font> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:8</b></font> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:9</b></font> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:10</b></font> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:11</b></font> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:12</b></font> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:13</b></font> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:14</b></font> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:15</b></font> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:16</b></font> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:17</b></font> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:18</b></font> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:19</b></font> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:20</b></font> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:21</b></font> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:22</b></font> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:23</b></font> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:24</b></font> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:25</b></font> And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:26</b></font> But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:27</b></font> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:28</b></font> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:29</b></font> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:30</b></font> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:31</b></font> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:32</b></font> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:33</b></font> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:34</b></font> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:35</b></font> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:36</b></font> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:37</b></font> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:38</b></font> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:39</b></font> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:40</b></font> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:41</b></font> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:42</b></font> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:43</b></font> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:44</b></font> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:45</b></font> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:46</b></font> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:47</b></font> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 10:48</b></font> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:1</b></font> And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:2</b></font> And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:3</b></font> Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:4</b></font> But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:5</b></font> I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:6</b></font> Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:7</b></font> And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:8</b></font> But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:9</b></font> But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:10</b></font> And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:11</b></font> And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:12</b></font> And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:13</b></font> And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:14</b></font> Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:15</b></font> And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:16</b></font> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:17</b></font> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:18</b></font> When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:19</b></font> Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:20</b></font> And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:21</b></font> And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:22</b></font> Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:23</b></font> Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:24</b></font> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:25</b></font> Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:26</b></font> And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:27</b></font> And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:28</b></font> And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:29</b></font> Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 11:30</b></font> Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:1</b></font> Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:2</b></font> And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:3</b></font> And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:4</b></font> And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:5</b></font> Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:6</b></font> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:7</b></font> And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:8</b></font> And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:9</b></font> And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:10</b></font> When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:11</b></font> And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:12</b></font> And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:13</b></font> And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:14</b></font> And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:15</b></font> And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:16</b></font> But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:17</b></font> But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:18</b></font> Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:19</b></font> And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:20</b></font> And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:21</b></font> And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:22</b></font> And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 12:23</b></font> And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. </font>
