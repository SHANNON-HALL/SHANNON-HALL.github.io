He acknowledged him in his blessing, and gave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribes did he part them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:1</b></font> And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favour in the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men, whose memorial is blessed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:2</b></font> He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him, so that his enemies stood in fear of him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:3</b></font> By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for his people, and shewed him part of his glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:4</b></font> He sanctified him in his faithfuless and meekness, and chose him out of all men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:5</b></font> He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law of life and knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel his judgments. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:6</b></font> He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even his brother, of the tribe of Levi. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:7</b></font> An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments, and clothed him with a robe of glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:8</b></font> He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with rich garments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:9</b></font> And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:10</b></font> With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work of the embroidere, with a breastplate of judgment, and with Urim and Thummim; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:11</b></font> With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, with precious stones graven like seals, and set in gold, the work of the jeweller, with a writing engraved for a memorial, after the number of the tribes of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:12</b></font> He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour, a costly work, the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:13</b></font> Before him there were none such, neither did ever any stranger put them on, but only his children and his children's children perpetually. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:14</b></font> Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:15</b></font> Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: this was appointed unto him by an everlasting covenant, and to his seed, so long as the heavens should remain, that they should minister unto him, and execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in his name. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:16</b></font> He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, to make reconciliation for his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:17</b></font> He gave unto him his commandments, and authority in the statutes of judgments, that he should teach Jacob the testimonies, and inform Israel in his laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:18</b></font> Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned him in the wilderness, even the men that were of Dathan's and Abiron's side, and the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:19</b></font> This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in his wrathful indignation were they consumed: he did wonders upon them, to consume them with the fiery flame. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:20</b></font> But he made Aaron more honourable, and gave him an heritage, and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; especially he prepared bread in abundance: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:21</b></font> For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gave unto him and his seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:22</b></font> Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, neither had he any portion among the people: for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:23</b></font> The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord, and stood up with good courage of heart: when the people were turned back, and made reconciliation for Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:24</b></font> Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, that he should be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people, and that he and his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 45:25</b></font> According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Juda, that the inheritance of the king should be to his posterity alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto his seed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp;

46:1</b></font> Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of Moses in prophecies, who according to his name was made great for the saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of the enemies that rose up against them, that he might set Israel in their inheritance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:2</b></font> How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, and stretched out his sword against the cities! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:3</b></font> Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself brought his enemies unto him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:4</b></font> Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day as long as two? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:5</b></font> He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressed upon him on every side; and the great Lord heard him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:6</b></font> And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle to fall violently upon the nations, and in the descent of Beth-horon he destroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all their strength, because he fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followed the Mighty One. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:7</b></font> In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, and withheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:8</b></font> And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserved to bring them in to the heritage, even unto the land that floweth with milk and honey. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:9</b></font> The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained with him unto his old age: so that he entered upon the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an heritage: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:10</b></font> That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:11</b></font> And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory be blessed. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:12</b></font> Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let the name of them that were honoured be continued upon their children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:13</b></font> Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:14</b></font> By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord had respect unto Jacob. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:15</b></font> By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by his word he was known to be faithful in vision. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:16</b></font> He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed upon him on every side, when he offered the sucking lamb. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:17</b></font> And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:18</b></font> And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes cf the Philistines. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:19</b></font> And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man's goods, so much as a shoe: and no man did accuse him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 46:20</b></font> And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king his end, and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:1</b></font> And after him rose up Nathan to prophesy in the time of David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:2</b></font> As is the fat taken away from the peace offering, so was David chosen out of the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:3</b></font> He played with lions as with kids, and with bears as with lambs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:4</b></font> Slew he not a giant, when he was yet but young? and did he not take away reproach from the people, when he lifted up his hand with the stone in the sling, and beat down the boasting of Goliath? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:5</b></font> For he called upon the most high Lord; and he gave him strength in his right hand to slay that mighty warrior, and set up the horn of his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:6</b></font> So the people honoured him with ten thousands, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in that he gave him a crown of glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:7</b></font> For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and brought to nought the Philistines his adversaries, and brake their horn in sunder unto this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:8</b></font> In all his works he praised the Holy One most high with words of glory; with his whole heart he sung songs, and loved him that made him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:9</b></font> He set singers also before the altar, that by their voices they might make sweet melody, and daily sing praises in their songs. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:10</b></font> He beautified their feasts, and set in order the solemn times until the end, that they might praise his holy name, and that the temple might sound from morning. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:11</b></font> The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever: he gave him a covenant of kings, and a throne of glory in Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:12</b></font> After him rose up a wise son, and for his sake he dwelt at large. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:13</b></font> Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; for God made all quiet round about him, that he might build an house in his name, and prepare his sanctuary for ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:14</b></font> How wise wast thou in thy youth and, as a flood, filled with understanding! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:15</b></font> Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark parables. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:16</b></font> Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace thou wast beloved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:17</b></font> The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs, and parables, and interpretations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:18</b></font> By the name of the Lord God, which is called the Lord God of Israel, thou didst gather gold as tin and didst multiply silver as lead. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:19</b></font> Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, and by thy body thou wast brought into subjection. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:20</b></font> Thou didst stain thy honour, and pollute thy seed: so that thou broughtest wrath upon thy children, and wast grieved for thy folly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:21</b></font> So the kingdom was divided, and out of Ephraim ruled a rebellious kingdom. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:22</b></font> But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, neither shall any of his works perish, neither will he abolish the posterity of his elect, and the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away: wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob, and out of him a root unto David. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:23</b></font> Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seed he left behind him Roboam, even the foolishness of the people, and one that had no understanding, who turned away the people through his counsel. There was also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:24</b></font> And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they were driven out of the land. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 47:25</b></font> For they sought out all wickedness, till the vengeance came upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:1</b></font> Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:2</b></font> He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal he diminished their number. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:3</b></font> By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also three times brought down fire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:4</b></font> O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! and who may glory like unto thee! <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:5</b></font> Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul from the place of the dead, by the word of the most High: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:6</b></font> Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men from their bed: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:7</b></font> Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the judgment of vengeance: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:8</b></font> Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after him: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:9</b></font> Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery horses: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:10</b></font> Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and to turn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:11</b></font> Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall surely live. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:12</b></font> Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseus was filled with his spirit: whilst he lived, he was not moved with the presence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:13</b></font> No word could overcome him; and after his death his body prophesied. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:14</b></font> He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his works marvellous. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 48:15</b></font> For all this the people repented not, neither departed they from their sins, till they were spoiled and carried out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a small people, and a ruler in the house of David: </font>
