<p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:51</b></font> For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:52</b></font> And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:53</b></font> How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:54</b></font> Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:55</b></font> And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:56</b></font> But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:57</b></font> So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:58</b></font> And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:59</b></font> For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:60</b></font> Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were his guides. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might smite the king's army which was at Emmaus, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour nor swords to their minds. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these were expert of war. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our face this day: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> That so all the heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuing them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the mountain: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> When therefore they perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready to fight, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> They fled every one into the land of strangers. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> The next year therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and his armourbearer; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:32</b></font> Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness of their strength to fall away, and let them quake at their destruction: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:33</b></font> Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:34</b></font> So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:35</b></font> Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas' soldiers, and how they were ready either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers, and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:36</b></font> Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:37</b></font> Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:38</b></font> And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests' chambers pulled down; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:39</b></font> They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:40</b></font> And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:41</b></font> Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:42</b></font> So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:43</b></font> Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:44</b></font> And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:45</b></font> They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: wherefore they pulled it down, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:46</b></font> And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:47</b></font> Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:48</b></font> And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:49</b></font> They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:50</b></font> And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might give light in the temple. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:51</b></font> Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they had begun to make. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:52</b></font> Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:53</b></font> And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:54</b></font> Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps, and cymbals. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:55</b></font> Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had given them good success. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:56</b></font> And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:57</b></font> They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:58</b></font> Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:59</b></font> Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:60</b></font> At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:61</b></font> And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defence against Idumea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Now when the nations round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased them very much. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto the people, in that they lay in wait for them in the ways. </font>
