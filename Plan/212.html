<font size = "+2"><b>212: Sirach 2:17 - Sirach 7:10</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:17</b></font> They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 2:18</b></font> Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:23</b></font> Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:24</b></font> For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:25</b></font> Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:26</b></font> A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:27</b></font> An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:28</b></font> In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:29</b></font> The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:30</b></font> Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:31</b></font> And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not the needy eyes to wait long. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man in his distress. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer not to give to him that is in need. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turn away thy face from a poor man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him none occasion to curse thee: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Get thyself the love of the congregation, and bow thy head to a great man. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, and give him a friendly answer with meekness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of the oppressor; and be not fainthearted when thou sittest in judgment. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husband unto their mother: so shalt thou be as the son of the most High, and he shall love thee more than thy mother doth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them that seek her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to her early shall be filled with joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoever she entereth, the Lord will bless. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: and them that love her the Lord doth love. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: and he that attendeth unto her shall dwell securely. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:16</b></font> If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her; and his generation shall hold her in possession. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:17</b></font> For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her laws. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:18</b></font> Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:19</b></font> But if he go wrong, she will forsake him, and give him over to his own ruin. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:20</b></font> Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; and be not ashamed when it concerneth thy soul. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:21</b></font> For there is a shame that bringeth sin; and there is a shame which is glory and grace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:22</b></font> Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:23</b></font> And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good, and hide not thy wisdom in her beauty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:24</b></font> For by speech wisdom shall be known: and learning by the word of the tongue. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:25</b></font> In no wise speak against the truth; but be abashed of the error of thine ignorance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:26</b></font> Be not ashamed to confess thy sins; and force not the course of the river. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:27</b></font> Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; neither accept the person of the mighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:28</b></font> Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord shall fight for thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:29</b></font> Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:30</b></font> Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantick among thy servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:31</b></font> Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldest repay. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough for my life. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in the ways of thy heart: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lord will surely revenge thy pride. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto sin: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double tongue. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be the same. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his fall. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnation upon the double tongue. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for thereby thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull straying alone. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:22</b></font> For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:23</b></font> Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:24</b></font> And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:25</b></font> Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:26</b></font> Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:27</b></font> Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:28</b></font> For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:29</b></font> Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:30</b></font> For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:31</b></font> Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:32</b></font> My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:33</b></font> If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:34</b></font> Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:35</b></font> Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:36</b></font> And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:37</b></font> Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms. </font>
