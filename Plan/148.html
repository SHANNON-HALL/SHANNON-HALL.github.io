3:10</b></font> And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there he tarried a whole month, that he might gather together all the carriages of his army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiled all their temples, and brought them to nought. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and were troubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days in Jerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, which is over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the most. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest had commanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at Jerusalem. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, and with great vehemency did they humble their souls: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> Both they, and their wives and their children, and their cattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought with money, put sackcloth upon their loins. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Thus every man and women, and the little children, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:12</b></font> And cried to the God of Israel all with one consent earnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and their wives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations to rejoice at. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:13</b></font> So God heard their prayers, and looked upon their afflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:14</b></font> And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had their loins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free gifts of the people, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:15</b></font> And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel graciously. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war, and had shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all the tops of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaign countries: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes of Moab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, who this people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are the cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, and wherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, or captain of their army; <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> This people are descended of the Chaldeans: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, and made them slaves. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And God dried the Red sea before them, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and cast forth all that dwelt in the wilderness. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:15</b></font> So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordan they possessed all the hill country. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:16</b></font> And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that country many days. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:17</b></font> And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hateth iniquity was with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:18</b></font> But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captives into a land that was not their's, and the temple of their God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:19</b></font> But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:20</b></font> Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any error against this people, and they sin against their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcome them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:21</b></font> But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:22</b></font> And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the tent murmured, and the chief men of Holofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake that he should kill him. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:23</b></font> For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of the children of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that have no strength nor power for a strong battle <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:24</b></font> Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shall be a prey to be devoured of all thine army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And when the tumult of men that were about the council was ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur said unto Achior and all the Moabites before all the company of other nations, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, that thou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said, that we should not make war with the people of Israel, because their God will defend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain the power of our horses. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> For with them we will tread them under foot, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith king Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words shall be in vain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spoken these words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face no more from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out of Egypt. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fall among their slain, when I return. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hill country, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the passages: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall be taken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of my words shall be in vain. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hill country, and came unto the fountains that were under Bethulia. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And when the men of the city saw them, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every man that used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones against them. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, and returned to their lord. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> But the Israelites descended from their city, and came unto him, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him to the governors of the city: <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And they called together all the ancients of the city, and all their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him of that which was done. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> And he answered and declared unto them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:18</b></font> Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried unto God. saying, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:19</b></font> O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified unto thee this day. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:20</b></font> Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:21</b></font> And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should remove their camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is over against Esdraelon. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear their weight. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast, and said, <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in thine army. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, and let thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain: </font>
