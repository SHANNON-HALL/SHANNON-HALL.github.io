<font size = "+2"><b>361: Revelation 3:1 - Revelation 7:17</b></font><hr><font size = "+2"><p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:1</b></font> And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:2</b></font> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:3</b></font> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:4</b></font> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:5</b></font> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:6</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:7</b></font> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:8</b></font> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:9</b></font> Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:10</b></font> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:11</b></font> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:12</b></font> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:13</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:14</b></font> And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:15</b></font> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:16</b></font> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:17</b></font> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:18</b></font> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:19</b></font> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:20</b></font> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:21</b></font> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 3:22</b></font> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:1</b></font> After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:2</b></font> And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:3</b></font> And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:4</b></font> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:5</b></font> And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:6</b></font> And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:7</b></font> And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:8</b></font> And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:9</b></font> And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:10</b></font> The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 4:11</b></font> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:1</b></font> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:2</b></font> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:3</b></font> And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:4</b></font> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:5</b></font> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:6</b></font> And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:7</b></font> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:8</b></font> And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:9</b></font> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:10</b></font> And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:11</b></font> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:12</b></font> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:13</b></font> And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 5:14</b></font> And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever. <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:1</b></font> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:2</b></font> And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:3</b></font> And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:4</b></font> And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:5</b></font> And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:6</b></font> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:7</b></font> And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:8</b></font> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:9</b></font> And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:10</b></font> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:11</b></font> And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:12</b></font> And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:13</b></font> And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:14</b></font> And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:15</b></font> And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:16</b></font> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 6:17</b></font> For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? <p><font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:1</b></font> And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:2</b></font> And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:3</b></font> Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:4</b></font> And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:5</b></font> Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:6</b></font> Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:7</b></font> Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:8</b></font> Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:9</b></font> After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:10</b></font> And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:11</b></font> And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:12</b></font> Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:13</b></font> And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:14</b></font> And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:15</b></font> Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:16</b></font> They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. <font size = "+2"><b>&nbsp; 7:17</b></font> For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. </font>
